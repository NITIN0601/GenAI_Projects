**Introduction**



Morgan Stanley is a global financial services firm that maintains
significant market positions in each of its business segments—
Institutional Securities, Wealth Management and Investment
Management. Morgan Stanley, through its subsidiaries and
affiliates, provides a wide variety of products and services to a
large and diversified group of clients and customers, including
corporations, governments, financial institutions and
individuals. Unless the context otherwise requires, the terms
“Morgan Stanley,” “Firm,” “us,” “we” or “our” mean Morgan
Stanley (the “Parent Company”) together with its consolidated
subsidiaries. See the “Glossary of Common Terms and
Acronyms” for the definition of certain terms and acronyms used
throughout this Form 10-Q.


A description of the clients and principal products and services
of each of our business segments is as follows:


_Institutional Securities_ provides investment banking, sales
and trading, lending and other services to corporations,
governments, financial institutions and high to ultra-high net
worth clients. Investment banking services consist of capital
raising and financial advisory services, including services

restructurings, real estate and project finance. Sales and
trading services include sales, financing, prime brokerage and
market-making activities in equity and fixed income products,
including foreign exchange and commodities. Lending

real estate loans, providing secured lending facilities, and

annuity and insurance products; securities-based lending,
residential real estate loans and other lending products;
banking; and retirement plan services.


March 2020 Form 10-Q 2



_Investment Management_ provides a broad range of investment
strategies and products that span geographies, asset classes,
and public and private markets to a diverse group of clients
across institutional and intermediary channels. Strategies and
products, which are offered through a variety of investment
vehicles, include equity, fixed income, liquidity and
alternative/other products. Institutional clients include
defined benefit/defined contribution plans, foundations,
endowments, government entities, sovereign wealth funds,
insurance companies, third-party fund sponsors and
corporations. Individual clients are generally served through
intermediaries, including affiliated and non-affiliated
distributors.


Management’s Discussion and Analysis includes certain metrics
which we believe to be useful to us, investors, analysts and other
stakeholders by providing further transparency about, or an
additional means of assessing, our financial condition and
operating results. Such metrics, when used, are defined and may
be different from or inconsistent with metrics used by other
companies.


The results of operations in the past have been, and in the future
may continue to be, materially affected by: competition; risk
factors; legislative, legal and regulatory developments; and
other factors. These factors also may have an adverse impact on
our ability to achieve our strategic objectives. Additionally, the
discussion of our results of operations herein may contain
forward-looking statements. These statements, which reflect
management’s beliefs and expectations, are subject to risks and
uncertainties that may cause actual results to differ materially.
For a discussion of the risks and uncertainties that may affect
our future results, see “Forward-Looking Statements,”
“Business—Competition,” “Business—Supervision and
Regulation,” and “Risk Factors” in the 2019 Form 10-K, and
“Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements”
herein. In addition, see “Executive Summary” herein and “Risk
Factors” for information on the current and possible future
effects of the COVID-19 pandemic on our results.

**Executive Summary**


**Overview of Financial Results**


_**Consolidated Results**_


**Net Revenues**
_($ in millions)_


**Net Income Applicable to Morgan Stanley**
_($ in millions)_


**Earnings per Common Share** [1]


1. For further information on basic and diluted EPS, see Note 16 to the financial


statements.



We reported net revenues of $9,487 million in the quarter ended
March 31, 2020 (“current quarter,” or “1Q 2020”), compared
with $10,286 million in the quarter ended March 31, 2019 (“prior
year quarter,” or “1Q 2019”). For the current quarter, net income
applicable to Morgan Stanley was $1,698 million, or $1.01 per
diluted common share, compared with $2,429 million or $1.39
per diluted common share, in the prior year quarter.


See “Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic” herein for
information on the current and possible future effects of the
COVID-19 pandemic on our results.


**Non-interest Expenses** [1]

_($ in millions)_


1. The percentages on the bars in the chart represent the contribution of compensation

and benefits expenses and non-compensation expenses to the total.


  - Compensation and benefits expenses of $4,283 million in the

current quarter decreased 8% from $4,651 million in the prior
year quarter. The decrease was primarily due to decreases in
the fair value of investments to which certain deferred

compensation plans are referenced and compensation
associated with carried interest, partially offset by increases
in discretionary incentive compensation, and the formulaic
payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by the
mix of revenues.


  - Non-compensation expenses of $3,058 million in the current

quarter increased 14% from $2,680 million in the prior year
quarter. The increase was primarily due to higher volumerelated expenses and an increase in the provision for credit
losses for lending commitments.


**Income Taxes**


The prior year quarter included intermittent net discrete tax
benefits of $101 million, primarily associated with
remeasurement of reserves and related interest as a result of new

information pertaining to the resolution of multi-jurisdiction tax
examinations. For further information, see “Supplemental
Financial Information—Income Tax Matters” herein.

_**Business Segment Results**_


**Net Revenues by Segment** [1]

_($ in millions)_


**Net Income Applicable to Morgan Stanley by Segment** [1]

_($ in millions)_


1. The percentages on the bars in the charts represent the contribution of each business

segment to the total of the applicable financial category and may not total to 100%
due to intersegment eliminations. See Note 19 to the financial statements for details
of intersegment eliminations.


- Institutional Securities net revenues of $4,905 million in the

current quarter decreased 6% from $5,196 million in the prior
year quarter primarily reflecting losses on loans and lending
commitments held for sale and an increase in the provision
for credit losses on loans and lending commitments held for
investment, as well as losses related to investments associated
with certain employee deferred cash-based compensation
plans, partially offset by increases in Fixed Income and Equity
sales and trading revenues driven by increased volumes and
volatility.


- Wealth Management net revenues of $4,037 million in the

current quarter decreased 8% from $4,389 million in the prior
year quarter, primarily reflecting losses related to investments
associated with certain employee deferred cash-based
compensation plans, partially offset by higher Asset
management revenues and higher commissions driven by
market volatility.


Table of Contents


**Management’s Discussion and Analysis**


- Investment Management net revenues of $692 million in the

current quarter decreased 14% from $804 million in the prior
year quarter, primarily reflecting lower Investments revenues,
partially offset by higher Asset management revenues.


**Net Revenues by Region** [1, 2 ]

_($ in millions)_


1. The percentages on the bars in the charts represent the contribution of each region

to the total.
2. For a discussion of how the geographic breakdown of net revenues is determined,

see Note 19 to the financial statements.


Both the 34% increase in revenues in Asia and the 33% decrease

in revenues in EMEA were primarily attributable to Equity sales
and trading within the Institutional Securities business segment.
The Equity sales and trading revenues increase in Asia reflects
higher client volumes, while in EMEA market volatility and
reduced dividend expectations weighed on revenues in the
derivatives and financing businesses. Additionally, EMEA
results reflected markdowns of held-for-sale loans and lending
commitments.


**Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic**


The coronavirus disease (“COVID-19”) pandemic and related
government-imposed shelter-in-place restrictions have had, and
will likely continue to have, a severe impact on global economic
conditions and the environment in which we operate our
businesses.


In responding to this unprecedented situation, we have taken
measures to prioritize the health of our employees and their
families, and to be prepared operationally to serve our clients,
leveraging our business continuity planning and historical
investments in technology. More than 90% of our employees
are currently working from home, and to date, we have not
experienced any significant loss of operational capability, as we
have implemented our pandemic-related responses. We believe
we are prepared to continue to operate with the vast majority of
our workforce working remotely for as long as health guidelines
and prudence require, with limited impact to our operational
capabilities.


The coronavirus disease has impacted many people’s health
around the world, including many of our employees. Our



Chairman and CEO was diagnosed with the coronavirus in
March, but has fully recovered. The rest of the Firm’s Operating
Committee remain healthy and are sheltering in place.


With the COVID-19 impacts on individuals, communities and
organizations continuing to evolve, governments around the
world have reacted to the health crisis caused by the pandemic,
and central banks have taken steps to proactively address market
disruptions by cutting interest rates and providing liquidity
sources and other stimulus programs. See “Regulatory
Developments in Response to COVID-19” herein for further
details.


We also have taken several direct steps to provide assistance.
Our balance sheet has increased as we: support market and client
activity; take in increased deposits from our Wealth
Management clients; extend credit to our institutional and retail
clients to provide them with additional liquidity; and provide
financing to support COVID-19 impacted clients across
multiple sectors. Along with the seven other U.S. Banks
comprising the Financial Services Forum, we voluntarily ceased
our Share Repurchase Program to keep this capital available to
help clients and took action on the Federal Reserve's
encouragement to use its discount window by borrowing from
it. We have also taken steps to participate in other Federal
Reserve programs, notably the Primary Dealer Credit Facility
(“PDCF”).


Our financial condition, balance sheet, capital and liquidity have
remained strong. In March 2020, we saw deposit inflows of $38
billion as customers sought relative safety away from volatile
markets, and we raised more than $5 billion in new long-term
debt supplementing our liquidity position.


As further discussed in “Business Segments” herein, towards
the end of the current quarter, we observed the impact of the
pandemic on our business. The decline of asset prices, reduction
in interest rates, widening of credit spreads, borrower and
counterparty credit deterioration, market volatility and reduced
investment banking activity had the most immediate negative
impacts on our current quarter performance. Related to these
effects, the Firm experienced mark-to-market losses, net of
economic hedges of $610 million on loans and lending
commitments held for sale, provisions of $407 million for credit
losses on loans and lending commitments held for investment,
and losses of $384 million on fund and business-related
investments, net of hedges. At the same time, high levels of
client trading activity, related to market volatility, significantly
increased revenues for global macro products and Commodities
in Institutional Securities, and the transactional businesses in
Wealth Management.


Though we are unable to estimate the extent of the impact, the
continuing pandemic and related global economic crisis will
adversely impact our future operating results. Additionally, with
the continuance of many of the same negative impacts, without
the benefit of higher client trading activity experienced in the


5 March 2020 Form 10-Q

**Management’s Discussion and Analysis**


current quarter, it is uncertain that our financial objectives will
be attained within the originally stated two year time frame.


We continue to use the elements of our Enterprise Risk
Management framework manage the significant uncertainty in
the present economic and market conditions. See “Quantitative
and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk” in the 2019 Form 10K for further information about our Enterprise Risk
Management Framework.


In addition, refer to “Risk Factors” herein and Forward Looking
Statements in the 2019 Form 10-K.


**Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information**


We prepare our financial statements using U.S. GAAP. From
time to time, we may disclose certain “non-GAAP financial
measures” in this document or in the course of our earnings
releases, earnings and other conference calls, financial
presentations, definitive proxy statement and otherwise. A “nonGAAP financial measure” excludes, or includes, amounts from
the most directly comparable measure calculated and presented
in accordance with U.S. GAAP. We consider the non-GAAP

financial measures we disclose to be useful to us, investors,
analysts and other stakeholders by providing further
transparency about, or an alternate means of assessing, our
financial condition, operating results, prospective regulatory
capital requirements or capital adequacy.


These measures are not in accordance with, or a substitute for,
U.S. GAAP and may be different from or inconsistent with nonGAAP financial measures used by other companies. Whenever
we refer to a non-GAAP financial measure, we will also
generally define it or present the most directly comparable
financial measure calculated and presented in accordance with
U.S. GAAP, along with a reconciliation of the differences
between the U.S. GAAP financial measure and the non-GAAP

financial measure.


The principal non-GAAP financial measures presented in this
document are set forth in the following tables.

1. Adjusted amounts exclude net discrete tax provisions (benefits) that are intermittent

and include those that are recurring. Provisions (benefits) related to conversion of
employee share-based awards are expected to occur every year and, as such, are
considered recurring discrete tax items. For further information on the net discrete tax
provisions (benefits), see “Supplemental Financial Information—Income Tax Matters”
herein.
2. ROE and ROTCE represent annualized earnings applicable to Morgan Stanley

common shareholders as a percentage of average common equity and average
tangible common equity, respectively. When excluding intermittent net discrete tax
provisions (benefits), both the numerator and average denominator are adjusted.
3. The calculations used in determining our “ROE and ROTCE Targets” referred to in

the following section are the Adjusted ROE and Adjusted ROTCE amounts shown in
this table.
4. Average common equity and average tangible common equity for each business

segment is determined using our Required Capital framework (see "Liquidity and
Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements—Attribution of Average Common
Equity According to the Required Capital Framework” herein).
5. The sums of the segments' Average common equity and Average tangible common

equity do not equal the Consolidated measures due to Parent equity.
6. The calculation of ROE and ROTCE by segment uses annualized net income

applicable to Morgan Stanley by segment less preferred dividends allocated to each
segment as a percentage of average common equity and average tangible common
equity, respectively, allocated to each segment.



**Return on Tangible Common Equity Target**


In January 2020, we established an ROTCE Target of 13% to
15% to be achieved over the next two years.


Our ROTCE Target is a forward-looking statement that was
based on a normal market environment and may be materially
affected by many factors, including, among other things:
macroeconomic and market conditions; legislative and
regulatory developments; industry trading and investment
banking volumes; equity market levels; interest rate
environment; outsized legal expenses or penalties; the ability to
maintain a reduced level of expenses; and capital levels.


With the COVID–19 pandemic, and the current global economic
crisis that includes negative impacts from many of the
aforementioned factors, it is uncertain that the ROTCE Target
will be met within the originally stated time frame. See
“Coronavirus Disease (COVID–19) Pandemic” herein and
“Risk Factors” for further information on market and economic

conditions and their effects on our financial results.


For further information on non-GAAP measures (ROTCE
excluding intermittent net discrete tax items), see “Selected
Non-GAAP Financial Information” herein. For information on

the impact of intermittent net discrete tax items, see
“Supplemental Financial Information—Income Tax Matters”
herein.


**Business Segments**


Substantially all of our operating revenues and operating
expenses are directly attributable to our business segments.
Certain revenues and expenses have been allocated to each
business segment, generally in proportion to its respective net
revenues, non-interest expenses or other relevant measures.


For an overview of the components of our business segments,
net revenues, compensation expense and income taxes, see

and Results of Operations—Business Segments” in the 2019

Results in the Institutional Securities business segment reflect
constructive markets in January and February 2020 and the
significant effects of COVID-19 on markets in March. In
particular, in March:


- Uncertainty, driven by market volatility and the overall

environment, resulted in lower activity in Advisory and
Equity underwriting.


- Market volumes and volatility were significantly higher than

in the prior year quarter resulting in increased client activity
across the Sales and Trading businesses and widened bid-offer
spreads. Valuations were negatively impacted, and client
balances declined significantly in the Equity Financing
business.


 - Credit deteriorated rapidly, the results of which are reflected

in losses on held-for-sale loans and lending commitments
recorded in Other revenues, partially offset by positive hedge
results in Other Sales and Trading, aggregating to $610
million for the current quarter; provisions for loan losses
recorded in Other revenues, and lending commitments shown
in Non-compensation expenses, aggregating to $388 million
for the current quarter; Trading losses in certain Credit


March 2020 Form 10-Q 8



products within Fixed Income; and losses on certain
counterparties’ failure to meet margin requirements in Equity
sales and trading.


These effects, in the context of the full quarter’s results, are
further discussed herein.

Investment banking revenues of $1,144 million in the current
quarter were relatively unchanged from the prior year quarter,
reflecting lower results in our advisory business offset by higher
results in our fixed income underwriting business.

- Advisory revenues decreased in the current quarter primarily

as a result of lower volumes of completed M&A activity,
particularly large transactions.


- Equity underwriting revenues were relatively unchanged

compared with subdued results in the prior year quarter as
lower revenues in secondary block share trades were offset
by higher revenues in initial public offerings and follow-on
offerings.


Table of Contents


**Management’s Discussion and Analysis**


- Fixed income underwriting revenues increased in the current

quarter primarily due to higher overall volumes compared to
the prior year quarter, with higher revenues in investment
grade bond and non-investment grade loan issuances, partially
offset by lower revenues from investment grade loan
issuances.

2. Includes funding costs, which are allocated to the businesses based on

_**Equity**_


Equity sales and trading net revenues of $2,422 million in the
current quarter increased 20% from the prior year quarter,
reflecting higher results in both our financing and execution
services businesses.


  - Financing increased from the prior year quarter, primarily due

to higher average client balances, partially offset by the impact
of reduced dividend expectations on the valuation of certain
hedges. Net interest increased reflecting a reduction in
funding costs.


  - Execution services increased from the prior year quarter,

reflecting an increase in market volumes in cash equities
resulting in higher Commissions and fees, and higher client
trading activity in derivatives products, which was partially
offset by the impact of losses on certain counterparties’ failure
to meet margin requirements and the impact of reduced
dividend expectations on derivative valuations.


_**Fixed Income**_


Fixed Income sales and trading net revenues of $2,203 million
in the current quarter were 29% higher than the prior year
quarter, primarily driven by higher results in global macro
products, partially offset by lower results in credit products.


  - Global macro products Trading revenues increased primarily

due to higher client activity in both foreign exchange and rates
products, and the widening of bid-offer spreads from higher
market volatility. Higher average balances and lower funding
costs contributed to an increase in Net interest revenues.


  - Credit products Trading revenues decreased primarily due to

the widening of credit spreads which resulted in losses in
securitized products and municipal securities, partially offset
by increased revenues from client activity in corporate credit
products from higher volumes and widening bid-offer
spreads. Net interest revenues increased, primarily driven by
higher spreads on Agency products and higher average
balances in secured lending facilities.


  - Trading revenues from Commodities products and Other

decreased as a result of lower client structuring activity within
derivatives counterparty credit risk management, partially
offset by improved inventory management in commodities
due to higher market volatility in energy and metals. Net
interest revenues increased, reflecting lower funding costs.


_**Other**_


  - Other sales and trading revenues of $240 million in the current

quarter increased from the prior year quarter reflecting gains
on hedges associated with loans and lending commitments
compared with losses in the prior year quarter, partially offset
by losses related to investments associated with certain
employee deferred cash-based compensation plans.

Table of Contents


**Management’s Discussion and Analysis**


_**Investments, Other Revenues, Non-interest Expenses, and**_
_**Income Tax Items**_


_**Investments**_


- Net investment losses of $25 million in the current quarter

compared to gains in the prior year quarter, were primarily
driven by losses in the current quarter on an energy-related
investment and lower revenues from fund-related

distributions.


_**Other Revenues**_


 - Other net losses of $1,079 million in the current quarter were

primarily as a result of mark-to-market losses on loans and
lending commitments held for sale due to the widening of
credit spreads, compared with gains in the prior year quarter,
as well as an increase in the provision for credit losses on
loans held for investment.


March 2020 Form 10-Q 10



_**Non-interest Expenses**_


Non-interest expenses of $3,955 million in the current quarter
increased from the prior year quarter, primarily reflecting a 20%
increase in Non-compensation expenses.


- Compensation and benefits expenses remained relatively

unchanged in the current quarter as the benefit from a decrease
in the fair value of investments to which certain deferred

compensation plans are referenced was offset by an increase
in discretionary incentive compensation reflecting baseline
annual compensation estimates, exclusive of the benefit
noted.


- Non-compensation expenses increased in the current quarter

primarily due to higher volume-related expenses as well as
an increase in the provision for credit losses for lending
commitments held for investment.


_**Income Tax Items**_


Intermittent net discrete tax benefits of $101 million were
recognized in Provision for income taxes in the prior year
quarter. For further information, see “Supplemental Financial
Information—Income Tax Matters” herein.

Results in the Wealth Management business segment reflect the
significant effects of COVID-19 on the economy and markets
in March 2020. In particular, in March:


- The decline in global asset prices contributed to losses on

investments associated with certain employee deferred cashbased compensation plans of $426 million in the current
quarter.


- Already elevated market volumes and volatility compared to

the prior year quarter increased further, resulting in increased
commissions from client activity.


These effects, in the context of the full quarter’s results, are

**Net Revenues**


_**Transactional Revenues**_


Transactional revenues of $399 million in the current quarter
decreased 51% from the prior year quarter as negative Trading
revenues were partially offset by higher Commissions and fees
and Investment banking revenues.


- Investment banking revenues increased in the current quarter

primarily due to higher revenues from structured products and
closed-end fund issuances.


 - Trading revenues decreased in the current quarter principally

due to losses related to investments associated with certain

employee deferred cash-based compensation plans,
compared with gains in the prior year quarter.


- Commissions and fees increased in the current quarter

primarily due to increased client activity in equities.


_**Asset Management**_


Asset management revenues of $2,680 million in the current
quarter increased 14% from the prior year quarter primarily due
to higher fee-based assets levels at the beginning of the monthly
billing cycles in 2020 due to market appreciation and positive
net flows, partially offset by lower average fee rates.


See “Fee-Based Client Assets—Rollforwards” herein.

_**Other**_


Other revenues of $62 million in the current quarter decreased
23% from the prior year quarter primarily due to an increase in
the provision for credit losses.


_**Net Interest**_


Net interest of $896 million in the current quarter decreased 21%
from the prior year quarter primarily due to lower interest rates
on Loans and the investment portfolio, changes in our funding
mix, and higher prepayment amortization expense related to
mortgage-backed securities. These decreases were partially
offset by the impact of lower rates paid on brokerage sweep
deposits and higher Loan balances.


**Non-interest Expenses**


Non-interest expenses of $2,982 million in the current quarter
decreased 7% from the prior year quarter primarily as a result
of lower Compensation and benefits expenses, partially offset
by higher Non-compensation expenses.


- Compensation and benefits expenses decreased in the current

quarter, primarily due to decreases in the fair value of
investments to which certain deferred compensation plans are
referenced, partially offset by an increase in the formulaic


March 2020 Form 10-Q 12



payout to Wealth Management representatives driven by the
mix of revenues.


- Non-compensation expenses increased in the current quarter

primarily due to incremental expenses related to Solium
Capital, Inc., which was acquired in the second quarter of
2019.

Results in the Investment Management business segment reflect
the significant effects of COVID-19 on the economy and
markets in March 2020. In particular, in March:


 - The decline in global asset prices led to losses of $326 million

in the current quarter related to the reversal of accrued carried
interest, and losses on investments in certain of our funds, net
of economic hedges, and net losses in Trading revenues.


These effects, in the context of the full quarter’s results, are
further discussed herein.



**Net Revenues**


_**Investments**_


Investments revenues of $63 million in the current quarter
decreased 67% from the prior year quarter primarily as a result
of the reversal of accrued carried interest and investment losses

in certain private equity, real estate, and infrastructure funds and
losses on seed investments in certain funds. Partially offsetting
these decreases were higher carried interest and investment
gains in an Asia private equity fund, principally driven by gains
from an underlying investment, which is subject to certain sales
restrictions.


_**Asset Management**_


Asset management revenues of $665 million in the current
quarter increased 8% from the prior year quarter primarily as a
result of higher average AUM.


See “Assets Under Management or Supervision” herein.


**Non-interest Expenses**


Non-interest expenses of $549 million in the current quarter
decreased 13% from the prior year quarter primarily as a result
of lower compensation and benefits expenses, partially offset
by higher non-compensation expenses.

  - Compensation and benefits expenses decreased in the current

quarter primarily due to lower compensation associated with
carried interest and a decrease in the fair value of investments

to which certain deferred compensation plans are referenced.


  - Non-compensation expenses in the current quarter increased

from the prior year quarter primarily as a result of higher fee
sharing paid to intermediaries driven by higher average AUM.

**U.S. Bank Subsidiaries**


Our U.S. bank subsidiaries, Morgan Stanley Bank N.A.
(“MSBNA”) and Morgan Stanley Private Bank, National
Association (“MSPBNA”) (collectively, “U.S. Bank
Subsidiaries”) accept deposits; provide loans to a variety of
customers, from large corporate and institutional clients to high
net worth individuals; and invest in securities. Lending activity
recorded in the U.S. Bank subsidiaries from the Institutional

Securities business segment primarily includes loans and
lending commitments to corporate clients. Lending activity
recorded in the U.S. Bank subsidiaries from the Wealth

Management business segment primarily includes securitiesbased lending, which allows clients to borrow money against
the value of qualifying securities, and residential real estate
loans.

**Other Matters**


**Planned Acquisition of E*TRADE**


On February 20, 2020, we entered into a definitive agreement
under which we will acquire E*TRADE Financial Corporation
(“E*TRADE”) in an all-stock transaction. In the current quarter,
we filed our application with the Federal Reserve and in early
April the Hart-Scott-Rodino Antitrust waiting period expired.
The acquisition is subject to customary closing conditions,
including regulatory approvals and approval by E*TRADE
shareholders, and we continue to expect the acquisition to close
in the fourth quarter of 2020.


**Accounting Development Updates**


The Financial Accounting Standards Board has issued certain
accounting updates that apply to us. Accounting updates not
listed below were assessed and either determined to be not

applicable or are not expected to have a significant impact on
our financial statements.

Table of Contents


**Management’s Discussion and Analysis**


The following accounting update is currently being evaluated
to determine the potential impact of adoption:


 - _Reference Rate Reform._ This accounting update provides

optional accounting relief to entities with contracts, hedge
accounting relationships or other transactions that reference
LIBOR or other interest rate benchmarks for which the

referenced rate is expected to be discontinued or replaced.
This optional relief generally allows for contract
modifications solely related to the replacement of the
reference rate to be accounted for as a continuation of the

existing contract instead of as an extinguishment of the
contract, and would therefore not trigger certain accounting
impacts that would otherwise be required. The relief also
allows entities to change certain critical terms of existing
hedge accounting relationships that are affected by reference
rate reform, and these changes would not require dedesignating the hedge accounting relationship. The optional
relief can be applied beginning January 1, 2020, and ending
December 31, 2022. We plan to apply the accounting relief
as relevant contract and hedge accounting relationship
modifications are made during the course of the reference rate
reform transition period.


**Critical Accounting Policies**


Our financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S.
GAAP, which requires us to make estimates and assumptions
(see Note 1 to the financial statements). We believe that of our
significant accounting policies (see Note 2 to the financial
statements in the 2019 Form 10-K and Note 2 to the financial

statements), the fair value, goodwill and intangible assets, legal
and regulatory contingencies and income taxes policies involve
a higher degree of judgment and complexity. For a further
discussion about our critical accounting policies, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations—Critical Accounting Policies” in the
2019 Form 10-K.


**Liquidity and Capital Resources**


Senior management, with oversight by the Asset/Liability
Management Committee and the Board of Directors (“Board”),
establishes and maintains our liquidity and capital policies.
Through various risk and control committees, senior
management reviews business performance relative to these
policies, monitors the availability of alternative sources of
financing, and oversees the liquidity, interest rate and currency
sensitivity of our asset and liability position. Our Treasury
department, Firm Risk Committee, Asset/Liability
Management Committee, and other committees and control
groups assist in evaluating, monitoring and controlling the
impact that our business activities have on our balance sheet,
liquidity and capital structure. Liquidity and capital matters are
reported regularly to the Board and the Risk Committee of the
Board.


March 2020 Form 10-Q 16



**Balance Sheet**


We monitor and evaluate the composition and size of our balance
sheet on a regular basis. Our balance sheet management process
includes quarterly planning, business-specific thresholds,
monitoring of business-specific usage versus key performance
metrics and new business impact assessments.


We establish balance sheet thresholds at the consolidated and

business segment levels. We monitor balance sheet utilization
and review variances resulting from business activity and
market fluctuations. On a regular basis, we review current
performance versus established thresholds and assess the need
to re-allocate our balance sheet based on business unit needs.

We also monitor key metrics, including asset and liability size
and capital usage.

business segment. Total assets increased to $948 billion at March
31, 2020 from $895 billion at December 31, 2019.


Within Wealth Management, assets increased in the investment
portfolio comprising Cash and cash equivalents, Investment
securities and Securities purchased under agreements to resell,
as a result of significantly higher deposits in this segment, and
loans continued to grow.


Institutional Securities’ assets were also higher reflecting
increases within Cash and cash equivalents, primarily due to
higher initial margin related to derivatives; Customer and other
receivables, resulting from higher volumes of unsettled
transactions in line with market conditions; and loan growth in
March in support of client needs. Additionally, within
Institutional Securities, Trading assets and Securities borrowed
decreased, predominantly driven by corporate equities as the
markets declined. The decrease in Trading assets includes a
partial offset related to increased derivative exposures related
to market volatility.


**Liquidity Risk Management Framework**


The core components of our Liquidity Risk Management
Framework are the Required Liquidity Framework, Liquidity
Stress Tests and Liquidity Resources, which support our target
liquidity profile. For a further discussion about the Firm’s
Required Liquidity Framework and Liquidity Stress Tests, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—
Liquidity Risk Management Framework” in the 2019 Form 10K.


At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, we maintained
sufficient liquidity to meet current and contingent funding
obligations as modeled in our Liquidity Stress Tests.


_**Liquidity Resources**_


We maintain sufficient liquidity resources, which are comprised
of HQLA and cash deposits with banks (“Liquidity Resources”)
to cover daily funding needs and to meet strategic liquidity
targets sized by the Required Liquidity Framework and
Liquidity Stress Tests. The total amount of Liquidity Resources
is actively managed by us considering the following
components: unsecured debt maturity profile; balance sheet size
and composition; funding needs in a stressed environment,
inclusive of contingent cash outflows; legal entity, regional and
segment liquidity requirements; regulatory requirements; and
collateral requirements.


The amount of Liquidity Resources we hold is based on our risk
tolerance and is subject to change depending on market and
Firm-specific events. The Liquidity Resources are primarily
held within the Parent Company and its major operating
subsidiaries. The Total HQLA values in the tables immediately
following are different from Eligible HQLA which, in

Global Liquidity Reserve to Liquidity Resources, which is more closely aligned with
the regulatory definition of HQLA. Prior periods have been recast to conform to the
current presentation.


Liquidity Resources may fluctuate from period to period based
on the overall size and composition of our balance sheet, the
maturity profile of our unsecured debt and estimates of funding
needs in a stressed environment, among other factors. During
the current quarter, cash deposits at central banks have increased,
largely driven by an increase in deposits received from

customers.

**Regulatory Liquidity Framework**


_**Liquidity Coverage Ratio**_


We and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are subject to LCR
requirements, including a requirement to calculate each entity’s
LCR on each business day. The requirements are designed to
ensure that banking organizations have sufficient Eligible
HQLA to cover net cash outflows arising from significant stress
over 30 calendar days, thus promoting the short-term resilience
of the liquidity risk profile of banking organizations. The LCR
calculation applies weightings (or asset haircuts) to HQLA and
excludes certain HQLA held in subsidiaries.


As of March 31, 2020, we and our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are
compliant with the minimum required LCR of 100%. For further
information on regulatory developments that have impacted our
LCR, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory
Requirements—Regulatory Developments” herein.

of our liabilities equals or exceeds the expected holding period
of the assets being financed.


We fund our balance sheet on a global basis through diverse
sources. These sources include our equity capital, borrowings,
securities sold under agreements to repurchase, securities
lending, deposits, letters of credit and lines of credit. We have
active financing programs for both standard and structured
products targeting global investors and currencies.

1. Under the LCR rule, Eligible HQLA is calculated using weightings and excluding certain

HQLA held in subsidiaries.
2. Primarily includes U.S. Treasuries, U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities,

sovereign bonds and investment grade corporate bonds.


The reduction in the LCR was driven by lower average Eligible
HQLA amounts, which included the removal from Eligible
HQLA of certain securities used to secure intraday credit,
following a recent regulatory rule clarification.


_**Net Stable Funding Ratio**_


The NSFR requires banking organizations to maintain
sufficiently stable sources of funding over a one-year horizon.
In 2016, the U.S. banking agencies issued a proposal to
implement the NSFR in the U.S.; however, a final rule has not
yet been issued. For an additional discussion of the NSFR, see

and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—

Receivables under these financing transactions, primarily
margin loans, are included in Customer and other receivables

Deposits are primarily sourced from our Wealth Management
clients and are considered to have stable, low-cost funding

increased compared with December 31, 2019, primarily driven
by higher brokerage sweep and savings deposits as customers
sought relative safety away from volatile markets in March. In
addition, total deposits increased as a result of higher time
deposits. See Management’s Discussion and Analysis of

herein for further information on market and economic

conditions.

with original maturities greater than one year are generally
managed to achieve staggered maturities, thereby mitigating
refinancing risk, and to maximize investor diversification
through sales to global institutional and retail clients across
regions, currencies and product types.


The availability and cost of financing to us can vary depending
on market conditions, the volume of certain trading and lending
activities, our credit ratings and the overall availability of credit.
We also engage in, and may continue to engage in, repurchases
of our borrowings in the ordinary course of business.


For further information on Borrowings, see Note 12 to the
financial statements.


**Credit Ratings**


We rely on external sources to finance a significant portion of
our daily operations. The cost and availability of financing
generally are impacted by our credit ratings, among other things.
In addition, our credit ratings can have an impact on certain
trading revenues, particularly in those businesses where longerterm counterparty performance is a key consideration, such as
certain OTC derivative transactions. When determining credit
ratings, rating agencies consider both company-specific and
industry-wide factors. These include regulatory or legislative
changes, the macroeconomic environment and perceived levels
of support, among other things. See also “Risk Factors—
Liquidity Risk” in the 2019 Form 10-K.

We believe that accessing debt investors through multiple
distribution channels helps provide consistent access to the
unsecured markets. In addition, the issuance of borrowings with
original maturities greater than one year allows us to reduce
reliance on short-term credit sensitive instruments. Borrowings

possible upgrade, changing their outlooks from Positive to

On April 23, 2020, Fitch Ratings, Inc. placed the Parent
Company and MSBNA ratings on Negative outlook, a change
from Stable, related to their expectation of significant operating
environment headwinds due to the disruption to economic
activity and financial markets from the COVID-19 pandemic.


_**Incremental Collateral or Terminating Payments**_


In connection with certain OTC derivatives and certain other

agreements where we are a liquidity provider to certain
financing vehicles associated with the Institutional Securities
business segment, we may be required to provide additional
collateral, immediately settle any outstanding liability balances
with certain counterparties or pledge additional collateral to
certain clearing organizations in the event of a future credit
rating downgrade irrespective of whether we are in a net asset
or net liability position. See Note 6 to the financial statements
for additional information on OTC derivatives that contain such

contingent features.


While certain aspects of a credit rating downgrade are
quantifiable pursuant to contractual provisions, the impact it
would have on our business and results of operations in future
periods is inherently uncertain and would depend on a number
of interrelated factors, including, among other things, the
magnitude of the downgrade, the rating relative to peers, the
rating assigned by the relevant agency pre-downgrade,
individual client behavior and future mitigating actions we
might take. The liquidity impact of additional collateral
requirements is included in our Liquidity Stress Tests.


**Capital Management**


We view capital as an important source of financial strength and
actively manage our consolidated capital position based upon,
among other things, business opportunities, risks, capital
availability and rates of return together with internal capital
policies, regulatory requirements and rating agency guidelines.
In the future, we may expand or contract our capital base to
address the changing needs of our businesses.

**Regulatory Requirements**


**Regulatory Capital Framework**


We are an FHC under the Bank Holding Company Act of 1956,
as amended (“BHC Act”), and are subject to the regulation and
oversight of the Federal Reserve. The Federal Reserve
establishes capital requirements for us, including “wellcapitalized” standards, and evaluates our compliance with such
capital requirements. Regulatory capital requirements
established by the Federal Reserve are largely based on the Basel
III capital standards established by the Basel Committee and
also implement certain provisions of the Dodd-Frank Wall Street
Reform and Consumer Protection Act (“Dodd-Frank Act”). The
OCC establishes similar capital requirements and standards for
our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries. For us to remain an FHC, we must
remain well-capitalized in accordance with standards
established by the Federal Reserve and our U.S. Bank
Subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized in accordance with
standards established by the OCC. For additional information
on regulatory capital requirements for our U.S. Bank
Subsidiaries, see Note 15 to the financial statements.


**Regulatory Capital Requirements**


We are required to maintain minimum risk-based and leveragebased capital, and TLAC ratios. For more information, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—
Regulatory Capital Requirements” in the 2019 Form 10-K. For
additional information on TLAC, see “Total Loss-Absorbing
Capacity, Long-Term Debt and Clean Holding Company
Requirements” herein.


_Risk-Based Regulatory Capital._ Minimum risk-based capital
ratio requirements apply to Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier
1 capital and Total capital (which includes Tier 2 capital). Capital
standards require certain adjustments to, and deductions from,
capital for purposes of determining these ratios.


In addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratio
requirements, we are subject to the following Common Equity
Tier 1 buffers:

 - A greater than 2.5% capital conservation buffer;


- The G-SIB capital surcharge, currently at 3%; and


- Up to a 2.5% CCyB, currently set by U.S. banking agencies


at zero.


For a further discussion of the G-SIB capital surcharge, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—
Regulatory Requirements—G-SIB Capital Surcharge” in the
2019 Form 10-K.



Our risk-based capital ratios for purposes of determining
regulatory compliance are the lower of the capital ratios
computed under (i) the standardized approaches for calculating
credit risk and market risk RWA (“Standardized Approach”) or
(ii) the applicable advanced approaches for calculating credit
risk, market risk and operational risk RWA (“Advanced
Approach”). The credit risk RWA calculations between the two
approaches differ in that the Standardized Approach requires
calculation of RWA using prescribed risk weights, whereas the
Advanced Approach utilizes models to calculate exposure
amounts and risk weights. At March 31, 2020 and December 31,
2019, our ratios for determining regulatory compliance are
based on the Advanced Approach and the Standardized
Approach rules, respectively.


_Leverage-Based Regulatory Capital_ . Minimum leverage-based
capital requirements include a Tier 1 leverage ratio and an SLR.
We are required to maintain an SLR of 5%, inclusive of an
enhanced SLR capital buffer of at least 2%.


As of March 31, 2020, our risk-based and leverage-based capital
amounts and ratios, as well as RWA, adjusted average assets and
supplementary leverage exposure are calculated excluding the
effect of the adoption of CECL based on our election to defer
this effect over a five-year transition period. For further
information, see “Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory
Requirements—Regulatory Developments” herein.

is composed of the average daily balance of consolidated on-balance sheet assets
for the quarters ending on the respective balance sheet dates, reduced by disallowed
goodwill, intangible assets, investments in covered funds, defined benefit pension
plan assets, after-tax gain on sale from assets sold into securitizations, investments
in our own capital instruments, certain deferred tax assets and other capital deductions.
3. Supplementary leverage exposure is the sum of Adjusted average assets used in the

Tier 1 leverage ratio and other adjustments, primarily: (i) for derivatives, potential future
exposure and the effective notional principal amount of sold credit protection offset
by qualifying purchased credit protection; (ii) the counterparty credit risk for repo-style
transactions; and (iii) the credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet exposures.

1. Amounts reflect assets not in a defined category, non-material portfolios of exposures

and unsettled transactions, as applicable.


Credit risk RWA increased in the current quarter under both the
Standardized and Advanced Approaches primarily from an
increase in: i) Derivatives exposure, driven by market volatility;
ii) Commitments, guarantees and loans, driven by an increase
in commitments funded during the current quarter in the
Institutional Securities business segment; and iii) Other credit
risk, driven by an increase in unsettled transactions. Under the
Advanced Approach, the increased exposure in Derivatives and
widening credit spreads led to an increase in RWA related to
CVA. Partially offsetting the increase in Standardized RWA was
a decrease in Securities financing transactions.


Market risk RWA increased in the current quarter under the
Standardized Approach and Advanced Approach primarily due
to increases in Non-securitization specific risk charges and the
Incremental risk charge, both driven by increased exposures in
credit products, and an increase in Regulatory VaR mainly as a
result of a higher market volatility, partially offset by a decrease

1. Required ratios are inclusive of applicable buffers.The final rule imposes TLAC buffer

requirements on top of both the risk-based and leverage exposure-based external
TLAC minimum requirements. The risk-based TLAC buffer is equal to the sum of 2.5%,
the covered BHC's Method 1 G-SIB surcharge and the CCyB, if any, as a percentage
of total RWA. The leverage exposure-based TLAC buffer is equal to 2% of the covered
BHC's total leverage exposure. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in
restrictions on our ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of
dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses to executive
officers.
2. External TLAC consists of Common Equity Tier 1 capital and Additional Tier 1 capital

(each excluding any noncontrolling minority interests), as well as eligible LTD.
3. Consists of TLAC-eligible LTD reduced by 50% for amounts of unpaid principal due

to be paid in more than one year but less than two years from each respective balance
sheet date.


We are in compliance with all relevant TLAC requirements as
of March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019. For a further
discussion of TLAC and related requirements, see

in Securitization specific risk charges due to reduced exposures
to mortgage-backed securities.


The decrease in operational risk RWA under the Advanced
Approach in the current quarter reflects a decline in the severity
of execution-related losses.


**Total Loss-Absorbing Capacity, Long-Term Debt and**
**Clean Holding Company Requirements**


The Federal Reserve has established external TLAC, long-term
debt (“LTD”) and clean holding company requirements for toptier BHCs of U.S. G-SIBs (“covered BHCs”), including the
Parent Company. These requirements are designed to ensure that
covered BHCs will have enough loss-absorbing resources at the
point of failure to be recapitalized through the conversion of
eligible LTD to equity or otherwise by imposing losses on
eligible LTD or other forms of TLAC where an SPOE resolution
strategy is used. The External TLAC amount and ratios as of
March 31, 2020 are calculated excluding the effect of the
adoption of CECL based on our election to defer this effect over
a five-year transition period. Our External TLAC ratios that were
calculated including the full effect of the adoption of CECL also
exceeded each respective required ratio as of March 31, 2020.

**Capital Plans and Stress Tests**


Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, the Federal Reserve has
adopted capital planning and stress test requirements for large
BHCs, including us, which form part of the Federal Reserve’s
annual CCAR framework.


We submitted our 2020 Capital Plan (“Capital Plan”) and
company-run stress test results to the Federal Reserve on April
6, 2020. We expect that the Federal Reserve will provide its
response to our 2020 Capital Plan and publish summary results
of the CCAR and Dodd-Frank Act supervisory stress tests of
each large BHC, including us, no later than June 30, 2020. We
are required to disclose a summary of the results of our companyrun stress tests within 15 days of the date that the Federal Reserve
discloses the results of the supervisory stress tests. We may be
required to resubmit our Capital Plan under certain
circumstances, including in the event of a material change in
our risk profile, financial condition or corporate structure. See
“Risk Factors” in the 2019 Form 10-K.


For a further discussion of our capital plans and stress tests, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources—
Regulatory Requirements—Capital Plans and Stress Tests” in
the 2019 Form 10-K.


**Attribution of Average Common Equity According to the**
**Required Capital Framework**


Our required capital (“Required Capital”) estimation is based
on the Required Capital framework, an internal capital adequacy
measure. Common equity attribution to the business segments
is based on capital usage calculated under the Required Capital
framework, as well as each business segment’s relative
contribution to our total Required Capital.


The Required Capital framework is a risk-based and leverage
use-of-capital measure, which is compared with our regulatory
capital to ensure that we maintain an amount of going concern
capital after absorbing potential losses from stress events, where
applicable, at a point in time. The amount of capital allocated
to the business segments is generally set at the beginning of each
year and remains fixed throughout the year until the next annual
reset unless a significant business change occurs ( _e.g._,
acquisition or disposition). We define the difference between
our total average common equity and the sum of the average
common equity amounts allocated to our business segments as
Parent common equity. We generally hold Parent common
equity for prospective regulatory requirements, organic growth,
acquisitions and other capital needs.


The Required Capital framework is expected to evolve over time
in response to changes in the business and regulatory


March 2020 Form 10-Q 24



environment, for example, to incorporate changes in stress
testing or enhancements to modeling techniques. We will
continue to evaluate the framework with respect to the impact
of future regulatory requirements, as appropriate.

1. The attribution of average common equity to the business segments is a non-GAAP

financial measure. See “Selected Non-GAAP Financial Information” herein.


**Resolution and Recovery Planning**


Pursuant to the Dodd-Frank Act, we are required to periodically
submit to the Federal Reserve and the FDIC a resolution plan
that describes our strategy for a rapid and orderly resolution
under the U.S. Bankruptcy Code in the event of our material
financial distress or failure. Our next resolution plan submission
is expected to be a targeted resolution plan in July 2021.


As described in our 2019 resolution plan, which was submitted
on June 28, 2019, our preferred resolution strategy is an SPOE
strategy. In line with our SPOE strategy, the Parent Company
has transferred, and has agreed to transfer on an ongoing basis,
certain assets to its wholly owned, direct subsidiary Morgan
Stanley Holdings LLC (the “Funding IHC”). In addition, the
Parent Company has entered into an amended and restated
support agreement with its material entities (including the
Funding IHC) and certain other subsidiaries. In the event of a
resolution scenario, the Parent Company would be obligated to
contribute all of its Contributable Assets to our material entities

and/or the Funding IHC. The Funding IHC would be obligated
to provide capital and liquidity, as applicable, to our material
entities. The combined implication of the SPOE resolution
strategy and the requirement to maintain certain levels of TLAC
is that losses in resolution would be imposed on the holders of
eligible long-term debt and other forms of eligible TLAC issued
by the Parent Company before any losses are imposed on the
holders of the debt securities of our operating subsidiaries or
before putting U.S. taxpayers at risk.


For more information about resolution and recovery planning
requirements and our activities in these areas, including the
implications of such activities in a resolution scenario, see

Planning” in the 2019 Form 10-K.

**Regulatory Developments**


_**Stress Capital Buffer Final Rule**_


The Federal Reserve has adopted a final rule to integrate its
annual capital planning and stress testing requirements with
existing applicable regulatory capital requirements. The final
rule, which applies to certain BHCs, including us, introduces a
stress capital buffer (“SCB”) and related changes to the capital
planning and stress testing processes.


The SCB applies only with respect to Standardized Approach
risk-based capital requirements and replaces the existing
Common Equity Tier 1 capital conservation buffer, which is
2.5%. The SCB is the greater of (i) the maximum decline in our
Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio under the severely adverse
scenario over the supervisory stress test measurement period
plus the sum of the four quarters of planned common stock
dividends divided by the projected RWAs from the quarter in
which the Firm’s projected Common Equity Tier 1 capital ratio
reaches its minimum in the supervisory stress test and (ii) 2.5%.
Risk-based regulatory capital requirements under the
Standardized Approach will include the SCB, as summarized
above, as well as our Common Equity Tier 1 GSIB capital
surcharge and any applicable Common Equity Tier 1 CCyB.


The final rule makes related changes to capital planning and
stress testing processes for BHCs subject to the SCB. In
particular, the supervisory stress test will assume that BHCs
generally maintain a constant level of assets and RWAs
throughout the projection period. In addition, the supervisory
stress test will no longer assume that BHCs make all planned
capital distributions, although the SCB will incorporate the
dollar amount of four quarters of planned common stock
dividends, as summarized above.


The final rule does not change regulatory capital requirements
under the Advanced Approach, the Tier 1 leverage ratio or the
SLR.


The Firm’s initial SCB will be based on the results of the 2020

CCAR supervisory stress test which the Federal Reserve is
expected to publish by June 30, 2020. The SCB will take effect
on October 1, 2020 and will remain in effect until September
30, 2021, and will be updated annually thereafter based on the
results of the annual CCAR supervisory stress test, with a revised
SCB taking effect on October 1 each year.


Upon receipt of the SCB, we will evaluate whether to update
our Required Capital framework to take into account any
changes in our risk-based capital requirements that result from
the SCB.


The SCB final rule also includes a transitional arrangement for
the third quarter of 2020. Between July 1, 2020 and September
30, 2020, the Firm will be authorized to make capital
distributions that do not exceed the four-quarter average of



capital distributions for which the Federal Reserve indicated its
non-objection in the 2019 capital plan cycle, unless otherwise
determined by the Federal Reserve.


_**Revisions to Definition of Eligible Retained Income**_


The U.S. banking agencies have adopted an interim final rule
amending the definition of eligible retained income in their
respective capital rules. As amended, eligible retained income
is defined by the Federal Reserve as the greater of (i) net income
for the four preceding calendar quarters, net of any distributions
and associated tax effects not already reflected in net income,
and (ii) the average of net income over the preceding four
quarters. This definition applies with respect to any payout
restrictions applicable in the event of a breach of any regulatory
capital buffers, including any applicable CCyB, G-SIB capital
surcharge, capital conservation buffer, the enhanced SLR and,
once effective, SCB, which replaces the capital conservation
buffer under the Standardized Approach. The interim final rule
became effective March 20, 2020.


Separately, the Federal Reserve has adopted an interim final rule
amending the definition of eligible retained income under its
TLAC rule to be consistent with the revised definition of eligible
retained income in the regulatory capital framework, as
summarized above. The interim final rule became effective

March 26, 2020.


_**Regulatory Capital and Stress Testing Developments Related**_
_**to Implementation of CECL**_


The U.S. banking agencies have adopted an interim final rule
altering, for purposes of the regulatory capital and TLAC
requirements, the required adoption time period for CECL.
Under the interim final rule, banking organizations that
implement the new accounting standard before the end of 2020
may elect to follow the three-year transition available under a
prior rule or a new five-year transition. This five-year transition
involves a two-year delay in recognizing the effects on
regulatory capital of the new accounting standard, followed by
a three-year transition period during which the electing
organization phases out the aggregate capital effects of the twoyear delay. The interim final rule became effective March 27,
2020. We have elected to implement the five-year transition for
recognizing the potentially adverse effects of the adoption of
CECL.


In addition, pursuant to the The Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and
Economic Security Act (the “CARES Act”), banking
organizations are not required to comply with CECL, for
purposes of U.S. GAAP accounting, until the earlier of the end
of the COVID-19 national emergency declared by the President
of the United States on March 15, 2020 under the National
Emergencies Act or December 31, 2020. We have not elected
to delay our compliance with CECL for purposes of U.S. GAAP
accounting.

_**Regulatory Developments in Response to COVID-19**_


In the United States, the Federal Reserve, the other U.S. state
and federal financial regulatory agencies and Congress have
taken actions to mitigate disruptions to economic activity and
financial stability resulting from COVID-19.


_Federal Reserve Actions_


The Federal Reserve has established, or has taken steps to
establish, a range of facilities and programs to support the U.S.
economy and U.S. marketplace participants in response to
economic disruptions associated with COVID-19. Through
these facilities and programs, the Federal Reserve has taken
steps to directly or indirectly purchase assets or debt instruments
from, or make loans to, U.S. companies, financial institutions,
municipalities and other market participants.


In addition, the Federal Reserve has taken a range of other
actions to support the flow of credit to households and
businesses. For example, on March 15, 2020, the Federal
Reserve reduced the target range for the federal funds rate to 0
to 0.25% and announced that it would increase its holdings of
U.S. Treasury securities and agency mortgage-backed securities
and begin purchasing agency commercial mortgage-backed
securities. The Federal Reserve has also encouraged depository
institutions to borrow from the discount window and has

lowered the primary credit rate for such borrowings by 150 basis
points to 0.25% while extending the term of such loans up to 90
days. In addition, effective March 26, 2020, reserve
requirements have been reduced to zero.


Acting in concert with the other U.S. banking agencies, the
Federal Reserve has also issued statements encouraging banking
organizations to use their capital and liquidity buffers as they
lend to households and businesses affected by COVID-19. To
facilitate banking organizations' use of their capital buffers, the
Federal Reserve has revised the definition of eligible retained
income applicable in the capital and TLAC frameworks.
Additionally, the Federal Reserve has adopted an interim final
rule that temporarily excludes U.S. Treasury securities and
deposits at Federal Reserve Banks from the calculation of our
supplementary leverage exposure used in the SLR. For a further
discussion about the revised definition of eligible retained
income and changes to the SLR calculation, see “Revisions to
Definition of Eligible Retained Income” and “Supplementary
Leverage Ratio Interim Final Rule,” respectively, herein.


Further, the Federal Reserve along with the other U.S. banking
agencies, issued guidance stating that granting certain
concessions to borrowers that are current on existing loans,
either individually or as part of a program for creditworthy
borrowers who are experiencing short-term financial or
operational problems as a result of the coronavirus pandemic,
generally would not be considered TDRs under applicable U.S.
GAAP. This guidance also clarifies that efforts to work with
borrowers of one-to-four family residential mortgages impacted


March 2020 Form 10-Q 26



by the COVID-19 pandemic and meeting certain criteria will
not result in such loans being deemed restructured or modified
for purposes of U.S. Basel III, and will therefore not be subject
to higher regulatory capital requirements.


As of March 31, 2020, we have participated in the PDCF, which
provides liquidity to primary dealers through a secured lending
facility, and, following the Federal Reserve's statement
encouraging banks to use its discount window, we have accessed
the discount window. While we continue to assess, we may
participate in other of these facilities and programs, including
on behalf of clients.


_Non-U.S. Central Bank Actions_


In addition to actions taken by the Federal Reserve, many nonU.S. central banks have announced similar facilities and

programs in response to the economic and market disruptions
associated with COVID-19. Firm subsidiaries operating in nonU.S. markets may participate, or perform customer facilitation
roles, in such non-U.S. facilities or programs.


_The CARES Act_


The CARES Act was signed into law on March 27, 2020.
Pursuant to the CARES Act, the U.S. Treasury has the authority
to provide loans, guarantees and other investments in support
of eligible businesses, states and municipalities affected by the
economic effects of COVID-19. Some of these funds may also
be used to support the several Federal Reserve programs and
facilities described in “Federal Reserve Actions” previously or
additional programs or facilities that are established by the
Federal Reserve under its Section 13(3) authority and meet
certain criteria. Among other provisions, the CARES Act also
includes funding for the Small Business Administration to
expand lending, relief from certain U.S. GAAP requirements to
allow COVID-19-related loan modifications to not be

categorized as TDRs and a range of incentives to encourage
deferment, forbearance or modification of consumer credit and

mortgage contracts.


The CARES Act also includes several measures that will

temporarily adjust existing laws or regulations. These include
providing the FDIC with additional authority to guarantee the
deposits of solvent insured depository institutions held in noninterest-bearing business transaction accounts to a maximum
amount specified by the FDIC, reinstating the FDIC’s
Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Authority to guarantee debt
obligations of solvent insured depository institutions or
depository institution holding companies, temporarily allowing
the U.S. Treasury to fully guarantee money market mutual funds
and granting additional authority to the OCC to provide certain
exemptions to the lending limits imposed on national banks.

_**Supplementary Leverage Ratio Interim Final Rule**_


In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Federal Reserve
has adopted an interim final rule that excludes, on a temporary
basis, U.S. Treasury securities and deposits at Federal Reserve
Banks from our SLR exposure measure from April 1, 2020 to
March 31, 2021. This interim final rule does not amend our U.S.
Bank Subsidiaries’ SLR requirements.


**Other Matters**


_**U.K. Withdrawal from the E.U.**_


On January 31, 2020, the U.K. withdrew from the E.U. under
the terms of a withdrawal agreement between the U.K. and the
E.U. The withdrawal agreement provides for a transition period
to the end of December 2020, during which time the U.K. will
continue to apply E.U. law as if it were a member state, and U.K.
firms’ rights to provide financial services in E.U. member states
will continue. Access to the E.U. market after the transition

period remains subject to negotiation.


We have prepared the structure of our European operations for
a range of potential outcomes, including for the possibility that
U.K. financial firms’ access to E.U. markets after the transition

period is limited, and we expect to be able to continue to serve
our clients and customers under each of these potential

outcomes.


For more information on the U.K.’s withdrawal from the E.U.,
our related preparations and the potential impact on our
operations, see “Risk Factors— International Risk” in the 2019
Form 10-K. For further information regarding our exposure to
the U.K., see also “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures
about Risk—Country and Other Risks."


_**Planned Replacement of London Interbank Offered Rate**_
_**and Replacement or Reform of Other Interest Rates**_


Central banks around the world, including the Federal Reserve,
have commissioned committees and working groups of market
participants and official sector representatives to replace LIBOR
and replace or reform other interest rate benchmarks
(collectively, the “IBORs”). Accordingly, we have established
and are undertaking a Firmwide IBOR transition plan to promote
the transition to alternative reference rates, which takes into
account the considerable uncertainty regarding the availability
of LIBOR beyond 2021.


For a further discussion of the expected replacement of the
IBORs and/or reform of interest rate benchmarks, and the related
risks and our transition plan, see “Management’s Discussion and
Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations—
Liquidity and Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements—
Other Matters” and “Risk Factors—Risk Management,”
respectively, in the 2019 Form 10-K.

**Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk**


Management believes effective risk management is vital to the
success of our business activities. For a discussion of our

Enterprise Risk Management framework and risk management
functions, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
Risk—Risk Management” in the 2019 Form 10-K.


**Market Risk**


Market risk refers to the risk that a change in the level of one or
more market prices, rates, indices, volatilities, correlations or
other market factors, such as market liquidity, will result in
losses for a position or portfolio. Generally, we incur market
risk as a result of trading, investing and client facilitation
activities, principally within the Institutional Securities business
segment where the substantial majority of our VaR for market
risk exposures is generated. In addition, we incur non-trading
market risk, principally within the Wealth Management and
Investment Management business segments. The Wealth
Management business segment primarily incurs non-trading
market risk from lending and deposit-taking activities. The
Investment Management business segment primarily incurs
non-trading market risk from capital investments in alternative
and other funds. For a further discussion of market risk, see
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Market
Risk” in the 2019 Form 10-K.


**Trading Risks**


We are exposed to a wide range of risks related to interest rates,
equity prices, foreign exchange rates and commodity prices, and
the associated implied volatilities and spreads, related to the
global markets in which we conduct our trading activities.


The statistical technique known as VaR is one of the tools we
use to measure, monitor and review the market risk exposures
of our trading portfolios.


For information regarding our primary risk exposures and
market risk management, VaR methodology, assumptions and
limitations, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
Risk—Market Risk—Trading Risks” in the 2019 Form 10-K.

1. Diversification benefit equals the difference between the total Management VaR

and the sum of the component VaRs. This benefit arises because the simulated
one-day losses for each of the components occur on different days; similar
diversification benefits also are taken into account within each component.
2. The high and low VaR values for the total Management VaR and each of the

component VaRs might have occurred on different days during the quarter, and
therefore, the diversification benefit is not an applicable measure.


While Average total Management VaR and average
Management VaR for the Primary Risk Categories were
relatively unchanged from the three months ended December
31, 2019, the period-end balance increased. The increase in
period-end VaR resulted primarily from the interest rate and
credit spread and equity price risk categories, which were
predominantly driven by increased market volatility related to
COVID-19, and reflected increased exposures in the Fixed
Income and Equity businesses related to client facilitation
activity and market movements in March 2020. These increases
were partially offset by an increased diversification benefit. For
information on the impact of COVID-19 on market and
economic conditions and their effect on our financial results,

Condition and Results of Operations—Executive Summary—
Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic” herein.

_**Distribution of VaR Statistics and Net Revenues**_


We evaluate the reasonableness of our VaR model by comparing
the potential declines in portfolio values generated by the model
with corresponding actual trading results for the Firm, as well
as individual business units. For days where losses exceed the
VaR statistic, we examine the drivers of trading losses to
evaluate the VaR model’s accuracy relative to realized trading
results. There were two days with trading losses in the current
quarter, one of which exceeded the 95%/one-day Total
Management VaR.

**Daily Net Trading Revenues for the Current Quarter**
_($ in millions)_


The previous histogram shows the distribution of daily net
trading revenues for the current quarter. Daily net trading
revenues include profits and losses from Interest rate and credit
spread, Equity price, Foreign exchange rate, Commodity price,
and Credit Portfolio positions and intraday trading activities for
our trading businesses. Certain items such as fees, commissions

-100 **(495)** (642)


The previous table presents an analysis of selected instantaneous
upward and downward parallel interest rate shocks (subject to
a floor of zero percent in the downward scenario) on net interest
income over the next 12 months for our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries.

These shocks are applied to our 12-month forecast for our U.S.
Bank Subsidiaries, which incorporates market expectations of
interest rates and our forecasted business activity.


We do not manage to any single rate scenario but rather manage
net interest income in our U.S. Bank Subsidiaries to optimize
across a range of possible outcomes, including non-parallel rate
change scenarios. The sensitivity analysis assumes that we take
no action in response to these scenarios, assumes there are no
changes in other macroeconomic variables normally correlated
with changes in interest rates, and includes subjective
assumptions regarding customer and market re-pricing behavior
and other factors. The change in sensitivity to interest rates
between March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019 is primarily
driven by lower market rates. Given the current rate
environment, the correlation between market rate increases and
deposit cost increases is low, and therefore provides an
incremental benefit in the +100bps scenario.

revenues and the VaR model. Revenues required for Regulatory
VaR backtesting further exclude intraday trading.

We have exposure to public and private companies through
direct investments, as well as through funds that invest in these
assets. These investments are predominantly equity positions
with long investment horizons, a portion of which is for business
facilitation purposes. The market risk related to these
investments is measured by estimating the potential reduction
in net income associated with a 10% decline in investment values

and related impact on performance-based fees, as applicable.
The change in investments sensitivity related to Investment
Management activities between March 31, 2020 and
December 31, 2019 is primarily driven by lower valuations in
private equity funds, related to the decline of global asset prices
due to the effect of COVID-19 on economies and markets around

the world. For information on the impact of COVID-19 on
market and economic conditions and their effect on our financial

results, refer to “Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive
Summary—Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic”
herein.


_**Equity Market Sensitivity**_


In the Wealth Management and Investment Management
business segments, certain fee-based revenue streams are driven
by the value of clients’ equity holdings. The overall level of
revenues for these streams also depends on multiple additional
factors that include, but are not limited to, the level and duration
of the equity market increase or decline, price volatility, the
geographic and industry mix of client assets, the rate and
magnitude of client investments and redemptions, and the
impact of such market increase or decline and price volatility
on client behavior. Therefore, overall revenues do not correlate
completely with changes in the equity markets. For information
on the impact of COVID-19 on market and economic conditions
and their effect on our financial results, refer to “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Executive Summary—Coronavirus Disease
(COVID-19) Pandemic” herein.


**Credit Risk**


Credit risk refers to the risk of loss arising when a borrower,
counterparty or issuer does not meet its financial obligations to
us. We are primarily exposed to credit risk from institutions and


March 2020 Form 10-Q 30



individuals through our Institutional Securities and Wealth
Management business segments. For a further discussion of our
credit risks, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
Risk—Credit Risk” in the 2019 Form 10-K.


The credit environment deteriorated rapidly towards the end of
the current quarter, driven by the effect of COVID-19 on
economic and market conditions. Within Institutional Securities

the effects were notable, with mark-to-market losses on heldfor-sale loans and lending commitments and increased
allowances for credit losses related to held-for-investment loans

and lending commitments, as discussed in Management’s
Discussion and Analysis. The uncertain environment also
caused an increase in client requests to draw down on lending
commitments and market volatility led to increased
counterparty credit exposures, both of which are further
discussed herein.


In addition, we have begun to have discussions with and receive
requests from certain clients for forbearance, or deferral of their
loan payments to us, driven or exacerbated by the economic
environment and following in part from the U.S. government’s
enactment of the CARES Act. These requests and discussions
primarily relate to commercial and residential real estate loans.
Certain clients have also requested modifications of covenant

terms.


The forbearance process is different based on loan and borrower
type, among other factors. In general, qualifying requests for
forbearance related to single family residential real estate loans
are immediately granted, whereas commercial real estate loan
forbearance requires negotiation and approval. Receiving or
granting forbearance or modification requests does not
necessarily mean that we will incur credit losses. As of April 30,
2020, the principal amount of loans for which forbearance
requests are currently active related to near-term payments on
commercial real estate loans and residential real estate loans

approximated $2 billion and $800 million, respectively.


These trends could continue in future periods given the present
uncertain global economic and market conditions. See
“Executive Summary—Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19)
Pandemic,” and “Risk Factors” herein for further information.

1. Investment Management business segment loans are related to certain of our activities

as an investment advisor and manager. At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019,
loans held at fair value are predominantly the result of the consolidation of CLO
vehicles, managed by Investment Management, composed primarily of senior secured
corporate loans.
2. Lending commitments represent the notional amount of legally binding obligations to

provide funding to clients for lending transactions. Since commitments associated with
these business activities may expire unused or may not be utilized to full capacity,
they do not necessarily reflect the actual future cash funding requirements.


We provide loans and lending commitments to a variety of
customers, from large corporate and institutional clients to high
net worth individuals. In addition, we purchase loans in the
secondary market. Loans and lending commitments are either
held for investment, held for sale or carried at fair value. For
more information on these loan classifications, see Note 2 to the
financial statements in the 2019 Form 10-K.


Total loans and lending commitments increased by
approximately $3 billion since December 31, 2019, primarily
due to growth in tailored lending and Residential real estate loans
within the Wealth Management business segment. In addition,
within the Institutional Securities business segment, there was
an increase in Corporate relationship and event-driven lending
commitments funded during the current quarter.


See Notes 4, 9 and 13 to the financial statements for further
information.

1. At December 31, 2019, the total allowance for credit losses for Loans and Lending

commitments was $349 million and $241 million, respectively.


Credit exposure arising from our loans and lending
commitments is measured in accordance with our internal risk

management standards. Risk factors considered in determining
the aggregate allowance for loan and commitment losses include
the borrower’s financial strength, industry, facility structure,
loan-to-value ratio, debt service ratio, collateral and covenants.
Qualitative and environmental factors such as economic and
business conditions, nature and volume of the portfolio and
lending terms, and volume and severity of past due loans may
also be considered.


The aggregate allowance for loans and lending commitments
increased in the current quarter, principally reflecting a
provision for credit losses within the Institutional Securities
business segment resulting from the economic impact of
COVID-19. This provision was primarily the result of higher
actual and expected future downgrades, an increase in funded
balances, principally in Corporate relationship and event-driven
loans, as well as revisions to our forecasts in light of current and
expected future market and macroeconomic conditions. See
Note 2 to the financial statements for a discussion of the Firm’s

allowance for credit loss methodology under CECL.

As a result of the economic impacts of COVID-19, there was
an increase in lending commitments funded during the current

The decline in economic activity, driven by the effects of
COVID-19, and recent decline in oil prices, have currently
impacted borrowers in many industries. The future
developments of COVID-19 and its related effect on the
economic environment are uncertain and may continue to
impact certain sectors and industries, in which we have, or may
in the future have, exposure in the form of loans or lending
commitments. In addition, refer to “Risk Factors” herein.


The Institutional Securities business segment lending activities
include Corporate relationship and event-driven lending,
Secured lending facilities, Commercial real estate lending and
Securities-based lending and other.


Corporate relationship and event-driven loans and lending
commitments typically consist of revolving lines of credit, term
loans and bridge loans; may have varying terms; may be senior
or subordinated; may be secured or unsecured; are generally
contingent upon representations, warranties and contractual
conditions applicable to the borrower; and may be syndicated,
traded or hedged. For additional information on event-driven
loans, see “Institutional Securities Event-Driven Loans and
Lending Commitments” herein.


Secured lending facilities include loans provided to clients,
which are primarily secured by loans on underlying real estate
or other assets. The underlying loans are associated with various
types of collateral, including residential real estate, commercial
real estate, corporate and financial assets. These facilities
generally provide for overcollateralization. Credit risk with
respect to these loans and lending commitments arises from the
failure of a borrower to perform according to the terms of the
loan agreement and/or a decline in the underlying collateral

**Risk Disclosures**


value. The Firm monitors collateral levels against the
requirements of lending agreements.


Commercial real estate loans are primarily senior, secured by
underlying real estate and typically in term loan form.


Securities-based lending and other includes financing extended
to sales and trading customers and corporate loans purchased in
the secondary market.

Event-driven loans and lending commitments are associated
with a particular event or transaction, such as to support client
merger, acquisition, recapitalization or project finance
activities. Balances may fluctuate as such lending is related to
transactions that vary in timing and size from period to period.
In the current quarter, credit spreads in the market for these loans
and commitments widened significantly, resulting in a
substantial slowdown in the volume of sales and syndications,
which is a trend that could continue in the future given the current
uncertain economic and market conditions. See “Executive

Summary—Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic” and

The principal Wealth Management business segment lending
activities include securities-based lending and residential real
estate loans.


Securities-based lending allows clients to borrow money against
the value of qualifying securities, generally for any purpose
other than purchasing, trading or carrying securities, or
refinancing margin debt. For more information about our
securities-based lending and residential real estate loans, see
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Credit
Risk” in the 2019 Form 10-K.


For the current quarter, Loans and Lending commitments
associated with the Wealth Management business segment
increased primarily due to growth in tailored lending and
Residential real estate loans.

At March 31, 2020, approximately 75% of Wealth Management
residential real estate loans were to borrowers with

"Exceptional" or "Very Good" FICO scores ( _i.e._, exceeding
740). Additionally, Wealth Management's securities-based
lending portfolio remains well-collateralized and subject to
daily client margining, which includes requiring customers to
deposit additional collateral, or reduce debt positions, when

necessary.

The Institutional Securities and Wealth Management business
segments provide margin lending arrangements, which allow
customers to borrow against the value of qualifying securities,
primarily for the purpose of purchasing additional securities, as
well as to collateralize short positions. Margin lending activities
generally have lower credit risk due to the value of collateral
held and their short-term nature. Amounts may fluctuate from
period to period as overall client balances change as a result of
market levels, client positioning and leverage.

**Risk Disclosures**


Employee loans are granted in conjunction with a program
established primarily to recruit certain Wealth Management
representatives and are full recourse and generally require
periodic repayments. The allowance for credit losses as of March
31, 2020 was calculated under CECL, while the allowance for
credit losses at December 31, 2019 was calculated under the
prior incurred loss model. The related provision is recorded in
Compensation and benefits expense in the income statements.
See Note 2 for a description of the CECL allowance
methodology, including credit quality indicators, for employee
loans. For additional information on employee loans, see Note

1. Counterparty credit ratings are determined internally by CRM.


We are exposed to credit risk as a dealer in OTC derivatives.
Credit risk with respect to derivative instruments arises from the
possibility that a counterparty may fail to perform according to
the terms of the contract. In the current quarter, our exposure to
credit risk arising from OTC derivatives has increased, primarily
as a function of the effect of market factors and volatility on the
valuation of our positions. For more information on derivatives,
see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—
Credit Risk—Derivatives” in the 2019 Form 10-K and Note 6

to the financial statements.


**Country Risk**


Country risk exposure is the risk that events in, or that affect, a
foreign country (any country other than the U.S.) might
adversely affect us. We actively manage country risk exposure
through a comprehensive risk management framework that
combines credit and market fundamentals and allows us to

effectively identify, monitor and limit country risk. For a further
discussion of our country risk exposure see, “Quantitative and
Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Country and Other Risks”
in the 2019 Form 10-K.


Our sovereign exposures consist of financial contracts and
obligations entered into with sovereign and local governments.
Our non-sovereign exposures consist of financial contracts and
obligations entered into primarily with corporations and
financial institutions. Index credit derivatives are included in

the following country risk exposure table. Each reference entity
within an index is allocated to that reference entity’s country of
risk. Index exposures are allocated to the underlying reference
entities in proportion to the notional weighting of each reference
entity in the index, adjusted for any fair value receivable or

payable for that reference entity. Where credit risk crosses
multiple jurisdictions, for example, a CDS purchased from an
issuer in a specific country that references bonds issued by an
entity in a different country, the fair value of the CDS is reflected
in the Net Counterparty Exposure row based on the country of
the CDS issuer. Further, the notional amount of the CDS adjusted
for the fair value of the receivable or payable is reflected in the
Net Inventory row based on the country of the underlying
reference entity.

1. Net inventory represents exposure to both long and short single-name and index

positions ( _i.e._, bonds and equities at fair value and CDS based on a notional amount
assuming zero recovery adjusted for the fair value of any receivable or payable).
2. Net counterparty exposure ( _e.g._, repurchase transactions, securities lending and OTC

derivatives) is net of the benefit of collateral received and also is net by counterparty
when legally enforceable master netting agreements are in place. For more
information, see “Additional Information—Top 10 Non-U.S. Country Exposures”
herein.
3. Amounts represent net CDS hedges (purchased and sold) on net counterparty

exposure and lending executed by trading desks responsible for hedging counterparty
and lending credit risk exposures. Amounts are based on the CDS notional amount
assuming zero recovery adjusted for any fair value receivable or payable. For further
description of the contractual terms for purchased credit protection and whether they
may limit the effectiveness of our hedges, see “Quantitative and Qualitative
Disclosures about Risk—Credit Risk—Derivatives” in the 2019 Form 10-K.

2. Collateral primarily consists of cash and government obligations.


_**Country Risk Exposures Related to the U.K.**_


At March 31, 2020, our country risk exposures in the U.K.
included net exposures of $22,283 million (as shown in the Top
10 Non-U.S. Country Exposures table) and overnight deposits
of $5,163 million. The $22,744 million of exposures to nonsovereigns were diversified across both names and sectors and
include $7,253 million to U.K.-focused counterparties that
generate more than one-third of their revenues in the U.K.,
$5,845 million to geographically diversified counterparties, and
$8,361 million to exchanges and clearinghouses.


**Operational Risk**


Operational risk refers to the risk of loss, or of damage to our
reputation, resulting from inadequate or failed processes or
systems, from human factors or from external events ( _e.g._, fraud,
theft, legal and compliance risks, cyber attacks or damage to
physical assets). We may incur operational risk across the full
scope of our business activities, including revenue-generating
activities ( _e.g_ ., sales and trading) and support and control groups
( _e.g._, information technology and trade processing). For a
further discussion about our operational risk, see “Quantitative



and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Operational Risk” in
the 2019 Form 10-K. In addition, for further information on
market and economic conditions and their effects on risk in

general, see "Management’s Discussion and Analysis of
Financial Condition and Results of Operations—Executive
Summary—Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic" and
“Risk Factors” herein.


**Model Risk**


Model risk refers to the potential for adverse consequences from
decisions based on incorrect or misused model outputs. Model
risk can lead to financial loss, poor business and strategic
decision making or damage to our reputation. The risk inherent
in a model is a function of the materiality, complexity and
uncertainty around inputs and assumptions. Model risk is
generated from the use of models impacting financial
statements, regulatory filings, capital adequacy assessments and
the formulation of strategy. For a further discussion about our
model risk, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about
Risk—Model Risk” in the 2019 Form 10-K.


**Liquidity Risk**


Liquidity risk refers to the risk that we will be unable to finance
our operations due to a loss of access to the capital markets or
difficulty in liquidating our assets. Liquidity risk also
encompasses our ability (or perceived ability) to meet our
financial obligations without experiencing significant business
disruption or reputational damage that may threaten our viability
as a going concern. For a further discussion about our liquidity
risk, see “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk
—Liquidity Risk” in the 2019 Form 10-K and “Management’s
Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition and Results of
Operations—Liquidity and Capital Resources” herein. In
addition, for further information on market and economic
conditions and their effects on risk in general, see
“Management’s Discussion and Analysis of Financial Condition
and Results of Operations—Executive Summary—Coronavirus
Disease (COVID-19) Pandemic” and “Risk Factors” herein.


**Legal and Compliance Risk**


Legal and compliance risk includes the risk of legal or regulatory
sanctions, material financial loss, including fines, penalties,
judgments, damages and/or settlements, or loss to reputation
that we may suffer as a result of failure to comply with laws,
regulations, rules, related self-regulatory organization standards
and codes of conduct applicable to our business activities. This
risk also includes contractual and commercial risk, such as the
risk that a counterparty’s performance obligations will be
unenforceable. It also includes compliance with AML, terrorist
financing, and anti-corruption rules and regulations. For a
further discussion about our legal and compliance risk, see
“Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosures about Risk—Legal
and Compliance Risk” in the 2019 Form 10-K.

**Report of Independent Registered Public Accounting Firm**



To the Board of Directors and Shareholders of Morgan Stanley:

**Results of Review of Interim Financial Information**


We have reviewed the accompanying condensed consolidated
balance sheet of Morgan Stanley and subsidiaries (the “Firm”)
as of March 31, 2020, and the related condensed consolidated
income statements, comprehensive income statements, cash
flow statements and statements of changes in total equity for the
three-month periods ended March 31, 2020 and 2019, and the
related notes (collectively referred to as the “interim financial
information”). Based on our reviews, we are not aware of any
material modifications that should be made to the accompanying
interim financial information for it to be in conformity with
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States of
America.


We have previously audited, in accordance with the standards
of the Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United
States) (PCAOB), the consolidated balance sheet of the Firm as
of December 31, 2019, and the related consolidated income
statement, comprehensive income statement, cash flow
statement and statement of changes in total equity for the year
then ended (not presented herein) included in the Firm’s Annual
Report on Form 10-K; and in our report dated February 27, 2020,
we expressed an unqualified opinion on those consolidated
financial statements. In our opinion, the information set forth in
the accompanying condensed consolidated balance sheet as of
December 31, 2019 is fairly stated, in all material respects, in
relation to the consolidated balance sheet from which it has been

derived.

**Basis for Review Results**


This interim financial information is the responsibility of the
Firm’s management. We are a public accounting firm registered
with the PCAOB and are required to be independent with respect
to the Firm in accordance with the U.S. federal securities laws

and the applicable rules and regulations of the Securities and
Exchange Commission and the PCAOB.


We conducted our reviews in accordance with the standards of

the PCAOB. A review of interim financial information consists

principally of applying analytical procedures and making
inquiries of persons responsible for financial and accounting
matters. It is substantially less in scope than an audit conducted
in accordance with the standards of the PCAOB, the objective
of which is the expression of an opinion regarding the financial
statements taken as a whole. Accordingly, we do not express
such an opinion.

See the “Glossary of Common Terms and Acronyms” for the
definition of certain terms and acronyms used throughout this
Form 10-Q.


A description of the clients and principal products and services
of each of the Firm’s business segments is as follows:

March 2020 Form 10-Q 44



insurance companies, third-party fund sponsors and
corporations. Individual clients are generally served through
intermediaries, including affiliated and non-affiliated
distributors.


**Basis of Financial Information**


The financial statements are prepared in accordance with U.S.
GAAP, which requires the Firm to make estimates and
assumptions regarding the valuations of certain financial
instruments, the valuations of goodwill and intangible assets,
the outcome of legal and tax matters, deferred tax assets,
allowance for credit losses, and other matters that affect its
financial statements and related disclosures. The Firm believes

that the estimates utilized in the preparation of its financial
statements are prudent and reasonable. Actual results could
differ materially from these estimates.


Certain reclassifications have been made to prior periods to
conform to the current presentation. The Notes are an integral
part of the Firm's financial statements. The Firm has evaluated
subsequent events for adjustment to or disclosure in these
financial statements through the date of this report and has not
identified any recordable or disclosable events not otherwise
reported in these financial statements or the notes thereto.


The accompanying financial statements should be read in
conjunction with the Firm’s financial statements and notes
thereto included in the 2019 Form 10-K. Certain footnote

disclosures included in the 2019 Form 10-K have been

condensed or omitted from these financial statements as they
are not required for interim reporting under U.S. GAAP. The
financial statements reflect all adjustments of a normal,
recurring nature that are, in the opinion of management,
necessary for the fair presentation of the results for the interim
period. The results of operations for interim periods are not
necessarily indicative of results for the entire year.


_**Consolidation**_


The financial statements include the accounts of the Firm, its
wholly owned subsidiaries and other entities in which the Firm
has a controlling financial interest, including certain VIEs (see
Note 14). Intercompany balances and transactions have been
eliminated. For consolidated subsidiaries that are not wholly
owned, the third-party holdings of equity interests are referred
to as noncontrolling interests. The net income attributable to
noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is presented as Net
income applicable to noncontrolling interests in the income
statements. The portion of shareholders’ equity that is
attributable to noncontrolling interests for such subsidiaries is
presented as noncontrolling interests, a component of Total
equity, in the balance sheets.


For a discussion of the Firm’s significant regulated U.S. and
international subsidiaries and its involvement with VIEs, see
Note 1 to the financial statements in the 2019 Form 10-K.

**2. Significant Accounting Policies**


For a detailed discussion about the Firm’s significant accounting
policies and for further information on accounting updates
adopted in the prior year, see Note 2 to the financial statements
in the 2019 Form 10-K.


During the three months ended March 31, 2020 (“current
quarter”), there were no significant revisions to the Firm’s
significant accounting policies, other than for the accounting
updates adopted.


**Accounting Updates Adopted in 2020**


See Note 16 for a summary of the Retained earnings impact of
this adoption.


**Financial Instruments — Credit Losses**


The Firm adopted the _Financial Instruments - Credit Losses_
accounting update on January 1, 2020.


This accounting update impacted the impairment model for
certain financial assets measured at amortized cost by requiring
a CECL methodology to estimate expected credit losses over
the entire life of the financial asset, recorded at inception or
purchase. CECL replaced the loss model currently applicable to
loans held for investment, HTM securities and other receivables
carried at amortized cost, such as employee loans.


The update also eliminated the concept of other-than-temporary
impairment for AFS securities and instead requires impairments
on AFS securities to be recognized in earnings through an
allowance when the fair value is less than amortized cost and a

credit loss exists, and through a permanent reduction of the
amortized cost basis when the securities are expected to be sold
before recovery of amortized cost.


For certain portfolios, we determined that there are _de minimus_
or zero expected credit losses; for example, for lending and
financing transactions, such as Securities borrowed, Securities
purchased under agreements to resell and certain other portfolios
where collateral arrangements are being followed. Also, we have
zero expected credit losses for certain financial assets based on
the credit quality of the borrower or issuer, such as U.S.
government and agency securities.


At transition on January 1, 2020, the adoption of this accounting
standard resulted in an increase in the allowance for credit losses

of $131 million with a corresponding reduction in Retained
earnings of $100 million, net of tax. The adoption impact was
primarily attributable to a $124 million increase in the allowance
for credit losses on employee loans.


The following discussion highlights changes to the Firm’s
accounting policies as a result of this adoption.



**Instruments Measured at Amortized Cost and Certain Off-**

**Balance Sheet Credit Exposures**


_**Allowance for Credit Losses (“ACL”)**_


The ACL for financial instruments measured at amortized cost

and certain off-balance sheet exposures ( _e.g.,_ HFI loans and
lending commitments, HTM securities, customer and other
receivables and certain guarantees) represents an estimate of
expected credit losses over the entire life of the financial
instrument.


Factors considered by management when determining the ACL
include payment status, fair value of collateral, expected
payments of principal and interest, as well as internal or external
information relating to past events, current conditions and
reasonable and supportable forecasts. The Firm’s forecasts
include assumptions about certain macroeconomic variables
including, but not limited to, U.S. gross domestic product, equity
market indices, unemployment rates, as well as commercial real
estate and home price indices. At the conclusion of the Firm’s
reasonable and supportable forecast period of three years, there
is a gradual reversion back to historical averages.


The ACL is measured on a collective basis when similar risk

characteristics exist for multiple instruments considering all
available information relevant to assessing the collectability of
cash flows. Generally, the Firm applies a probability of default
(“PD”)/loss given default (“LGD”) model (“PD/LGD model”)
for instruments that are collectively assessed, under which the
ACL is calculated as the product of PD, LGD and exposure at
default (“EAD”). These parameters are forecast for each
collective group of loans using a scenario-based statistical
model and at the conclusion of the Firm’s reasonable and

supportable forecast period, the parameters gradually revert
back to historical averages.


If the instrument does not share similar risk characteristics with

other instruments, including when it is probable that the Firm
will be unable to collect the full payment of principal and interest
on the instrument when due, the ACL is measured on an
individual basis. The Firm typically applies a discounted cash
flow (“DCF”) method for instruments that are individually
assessed.


The Firm may also elect to use an approach that considers the
fair value of the collateral when measuring the ACL if the loan
is collateral dependent ( _i.e.,_ repayment of the loan is expected
to be provided substantially by the sale or operation of the
underlying collateral and the borrower is experiencing financial
difficulty).


Additionally, the Firm can elect to use an approach to measure
the ACL using the fair value of collateral where the borrower is
required to, and reasonably expected to, continually adjust and
replenish the amount of collateral securing the instrument to
reflect changes in the fair value of such collateral. The Firm has


45 March 2020 Form 10-Q


Table of Contents

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**
**(Unaudited)**


elected to use this approach for certain securities-based loans,
customer receivables representing margin loans, Securities
purchased under agreements to resell and Securities borrowed.


Credit quality indicators considered in developing the ACL
include:


 - Corporate loans and Commercial real estate loans and

securities: Internal risk ratings developed by CRM which are
refreshed at least annually, and more frequently as necessary.
These ratings generally correspond to external ratings
published by S&P. The Firm also considers transaction
structure, including type of collateral, collateral terms, and
position of the obligation within the capital structure. In
addition, for Commercial real estate, the Firm considers
property type and location, net operating income, LTV ratios,
among others, as well as commercial real estate price and
credit spread indices and capitalization rates.

 - Residential real estate loans: Loan origination Fair Isaac

Corporation (“FICO”) credit scores as determined by
independent credit agencies in the United States and loanto-value (“LTV”) ratios.

 - Employee loans: Employment status, which includes those

currently employed by the Firm and for which the Firm can
deduct any unpaid amounts due to it through certain
compensation arrangements; and those no longer employed
by the Firm where such compensation arrangements are no
longer applicable.


Consumer loans primarily comprise securities-based loans and
therefore the Firm generally measures the ACL on such loans
based on the fair value of collateral.


Qualitative and environmental factors such as economic and
business conditions, the nature and volume of the portfolio, and
lending terms and the volume and severity of past due loans are
also considered in the ACL calculations.


_Recognition_ . The Firm recognizes its ACL and provision for
credit losses in its balance sheets and income statements,
respectively, for on– and off–balance sheet instruments as
follows.



**ACL**



**Provision for**
**credit losses**



Instruments measured at amortized

cost ( _e.g.,_ HFI loans, HTM securities
and customer and other

expenses Other expense



_**Troubled Debt Restructurings (“TDRs”)**_


The Firm may modify the terms of certain loans for economic
or legal reasons related to a borrower’s financial difficulties by
granting one or more concessions that the Firm would not


March 2020 Form 10-Q 46



otherwise consider. Such modifications are accounted for and

reported as a TDR, except for certain modifications related to
the Coronavirus Disease (“COVID-19”) as noted in
“Modifications and Nonaccrual Status for Borrowers Impacted
by COVID-19” herein. A loan that has been modified in a TDR
is generally considered to be impaired and is evaluated
individually. TDRs are also generally classified as nonaccrual
and may be returned to accrual status only after the Firm expects
repayment of the remaining contractual principal and interest
and there is sustained repayment performance for a reasonable
period.


_**Nonaccrual**_


The Firm places financial instruments on nonaccrual status if
principal or interest is past due for a period of 90 days or more
or payment of principal or interest is in doubt unless the
obligation is well-secured and in the process of collection, or in
certain cases when related to the Coronavirus Disease

(“COVID-19”) as noted in “Modifications and Nonaccrual
Status for Borrowers Impacted by COVID-19” herein. For any
instrument placed on nonaccrual status, the Firm reverses any
unpaid interest accrued with an offsetting reduction to Interest
income. Principal and interest payments received on nonaccrual
instruments are applied to principal if there is doubt regarding
the ultimate collectability of principal. If collection of the
principal is not in doubt, interest income is realized on a cash
basis. If neither principal nor interest collection is in doubt and
the instruments are brought current, instruments are generally
placed on accrual status and interest income is recognized using
the effective interest method.


_**Modifications and Nonaccrual Status for Borrowers Impacted**_
_**by COVID-19**_


In the first quarter of 2020, the Firm elected to apply the guidance
issued by Congress in the Coronavirus Aid, Relief, and
Economic Security Act (“CARES Act”) as well as by the U.S.
banking agencies stating that certain concessions granted to
borrowers that are current on existing loans, either individually
or as part of a program for creditworthy borrowers who are
experiencing short-term financial or operational problems as a
result of the coronavirus pandemic, generally would not be
considered TDRs or nonaccrual.


_**ACL Write-offs**_


The Firm writes-off a financial instrument in the period that it
is deemed uncollectible and records a reduction in the ACL and

the balance of the financial instrument in the balance sheet.

However, for accrued interest receivable balances that are
separately recorded from the related financial instruments, the
Firm's nonaccrual policy requires that accrued interest
receivable be written off against Interest income when the
related financial instrument is placed in nonaccrual status.
Accordingly, the Firm elected not to measure an ACL for accrued
interest receivables.

**Available-for-Sale (“AFS”) Investment Securities**


_**Unrealized Losses on AFS Securities**_


AFS securities are analyzed as part of the Firm's periodic
assessment of credit losses at the individual security level. When
considering if a credit loss exists, the Firm considers relevant
information as discussed in Note 2 of the 2019 Form 10-K. Upon
the adoption of _Financial Instruments—Credit Losses_, the Firm
no longer considers the length of time the fair value has been
less than the amortized cost basis in determining whether a credit
loss exists.


_Recognition_ . The Firm recognizes its ACL and provision for
credit losses for AFS securities in its balance sheets and income

statements, respectively, as follows.


**Provision for credit**



**ACL**



**losses**



AFS securities Contra asset Other revenue


The Firm recognizes the non-credit loss component of the
unrealized loss as an adjustment to the security’s asset balance
with an offsetting entry to AOCI in the balance sheets.


For AFS securities in an unrealized loss position as of the balance
sheet date that the Firm either has the intent to sell or that the

Firm is likely to be required to sell before recovery of its
amortized cost basis, any allowance for credit losses previously
established is written off and the amortized cost basis is written

down to the security’s fair value with any incremental unrealized
losses reported in Other revenues.


_**Nonaccrual & ACL Write-Offs on AFS Securities**_


AFS securities follow the same nonaccrual and write-off

guidance as discussed in “Instruments Measured at Amortized
Cost and Certain Off-Balance Sheet Credit Exposures” herein.


**3. Cash and Cash Equivalents**


Cash and cash equivalents consist of Cash and due from banks
and Interest bearing deposits with banks. Cash equivalents are
highly liquid investments with remaining maturities of three
months or less from the acquisition date that are readily
convertible to cash and are not held for trading purposes.

1. A single amount is disclosed for range and average when there is no significant

difference between the minimum, maximum and average. Amounts represent
weighted averages except where simple averages and the median of the inputs are
more relevant.
2. Includes derivative contracts with multiple risks ( _i.e._, hybrid products).


The previous tables provide information on the valuation
techniques, significant unobservable inputs, and the ranges and
averages for each major category of assets and liabilities
measured at fair value on a recurring and nonrecurring basis
with a significant Level 3 balance. The level of aggregation and
breadth of products cause the range of inputs to be wide and not
evenly distributed across the inventory of financial instruments.
Further, the range of unobservable inputs may differ across firms
in the financial services industry because of diversity in the types
of products included in each firm’s inventory. There are no
predictable relationships between multiple significant
unobservable inputs attributable to a given valuation technique.


For a description of the Firm’s significant unobservable inputs
and qualitative information about the effect of hypothetical
changes in the values of those inputs, see Note 3 to the financial
statements in the 2019 Form 10-K. During the current quarter,
there were no significant revisions made to the descriptions of
the Firm’s significant unobservable inputs.

1. Investments in hedge funds may be subject to initial period lock-up or gate provisions,

which restrict an investor from withdrawing from the fund during a certain initial period
or restrict the redemption amount on any redemption date, respectively.


Amounts in the previous table represent the Firm’s carrying
value of general and limited partnership interests in fund
investments, as well as any related performance-based fees in
the form of carried interest. The carrying amounts are measured
based on the NAV of the fund taking into account the distribution
terms applicable to the interest held. This same measurement
applies whether the fund investments are accounted for under
the equity method or fair value.

1. Gains and losses for Loans and Other assets—Other investments are classified in

Other revenues. For other items, gains and losses are recorded in Other revenues if
the item is held for sale; otherwise, they are recorded in Other expenses.
2. Nonrecurring changes in the fair value of loans and lending commitments were

calculated as follows: for the held-for-investment category, based on the value of the
underlying collateral; and for the held-for-sale category, based on recently executed
transactions, market price quotations, valuation models that incorporate market
observable inputs where possible, such as comparable loan or debt prices and CDS
spread levels adjusted for any basis difference between cash and derivative
instruments, or default recovery analysis where such transactions and quotations are
unobservable.
3. Losses related to Other assets—Other investments were determined using techniques

that included discounted cash flow models, methodologies that incorporate multiples
of certain comparable companies and recently executed transactions.
4. Losses related to Other assets—Premises, equipment and software generally include

write-offs related to the disposal of certain assets.

The Firm has elected the fair value option for certain eligible
instruments that are risk managed on a fair value basis to mitigate
income statement volatility caused by measurement basis
differences between the elected instruments and their associated

risk management transactions or to eliminate complexities of

The Firm believes that the notional amounts of derivative

contracts generally overstate its exposure. In most
circumstances, notional amounts are used only as a reference
point from which to calculate amounts owed between the parties
to the contract. Furthermore, notional amounts do not reflect the
benefit of legally enforceable netting arrangements or risk
mitigating transactions.


For a discussion of the Firm's derivative instruments and

hedging activities, see Note 5 to the financial statements in the
2019 Form 10-K.

For AFS securities, the Firm believes there are no securities in
an unrealized loss position that have credit losses after
performing the analysis described in Note 2. Additionally, the
Firm does not intend to sell the securities and is not likely to be
required to sell the securities prior to recovery of the amortized
cost basis. Furthermore, the securities have not experienced
credit losses as they are predominantly investment-grade and
the Firm expects to recover the amortized cost basis.


March 2020 Form 10-Q 60



As of March 31, 2020, the HTM securities net carrying amount
reflects an amortized cost of $47,312 million less an allowance
for credit losses of $26 million related to Non-agency CMBS.
See Note 2 for a description of the ACL methodology used
beginning in 2020 following the Firm's adoption of CECL and
see Note 2 to the financial statements in the 2019 Form 10-K

for prior period credit loss considerations. There were no
securities in an unrealized loss position as of December 31, 2019
that had credit losses. As of March 31, 2020, and December 31,
2019, Non-Agency CMBS HTM securities were all on accrual
status and were predominantly investment-grade.


See Note 14 for additional information on securities issued by
VIEs, including U.S. agency mortgage-backed securities, nonagency CMBS and FFELP student loan ABS.

The aggregate allowance for loans and lending commitments
increased in the current quarter, principally reflecting a
provision for credit losses within the Institutional Securities
business segment resulting from the economic impact of
COVID-19. This provision was primarily the result of higher
actual and expected future downgrades, an increase in funded
balances, principally in Corporate relationship and event-driven
loans, as well as revisions to our forecasts in light of current and
expected future market and macroeconomic conditions. For a
further discussion of the Firm’s loans, including loan types and
categories, as well as the Firm’s allowance methodology prior
to the adoption of CECL, refer to Notes 2 and 8 to the financial

repayments, and are due in full upon termination of employment
with the Firm. These loans are recorded in Customer and other

formed a joint venture in Japan comprising their respective
investment banking and securities businesses by forming two
joint venture companies, Mitsubishi UFJ Morgan Stanley
Securities Co., Ltd. (“MUMSS”) and Morgan Stanley MUFG
Securities Co., Ltd. (“MSMS”) (the “Joint Venture”). The Firm
owns a 40% economic interest in the Joint Venture and MUFG

owns the other 60%.


The Firm’s 40% voting interest in MUMSS is accounted for
under the equity method within the Institutional Securities
business segment, and is included in the equity method
investment balances above. The Firm consolidates MSMS into

the Institutional Securities business segment, based on its 51%
voting interest.


The Firm engages in transactions in the ordinary course of
business with MUFG and its affiliates, for example investment
banking, financial advisory, sales and trading, derivatives,
investment management, lending, securitization and other
financial services transactions. Such transactions are on

substantially the same terms as those that would be available to
unrelated third parties for comparable transactions.

3. Primarily related to residential mortgage securitizations.


The Firm has obligations under certain guarantee arrangements,
including contracts and indemnification agreements, that
contingently require the Firm to make payments to the
guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying measure
(such as an interest or foreign exchange rate, security or
commodity price, an index, or the occurrence or non-occurrence
of a specified event) related to an asset, liability or equity
security of a guaranteed party. Also included as guarantees are


Table of Contents

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**
**(Unaudited)**


contracts that contingently require the Firm to make payments
to the guaranteed party based on another entity’s failure to
perform under an agreement, as well as indirect guarantees of
the indebtedness of others.


_Client Clearing Guarantees._ In the first quarter of 2020, FICC’s
sponsored clearing model was updated such that the Firm could
be responsible for liquidation of a sponsored member’s account
and guarantees any resulting loss to the FICC in the event the
sponsored member fails to fully pay any net liquidation amount
due from the sponsored member to the FICC. Accordingly, the
Firm’s maximum potential payout amount as of March 31, 2020
reflects the total of the estimated net liquidation amounts for
sponsored member accounts.


For more information on the nature of the obligations and related
business activities for our guarantees, see Note 13 to the
financial statements in the 2019 Form 10-K.


**Other Guarantees and Indemnities**


In the normal course of business, the Firm provides guarantees
and indemnifications in a variety of transactions. These
provisions generally are standard contractual terms. Certain of
these guarantees and indemnifications related to indemnities,
exchange and clearinghouse member guarantees and merger and
acquisition guarantees are described in Note 13 to the financial
statements in the 2019 Form 10-K.


In addition, in the ordinary course of business, the Firm
guarantees the debt and/or certain trading obligations (including
obligations associated with derivatives, foreign exchange
contracts and the settlement of physical commodities) of certain
subsidiaries. These guarantees generally are entity or product
specific and are required by investors or trading counterparties.
The activities of the Firm’s subsidiaries covered by these
guarantees (including any related debt or trading obligations)
are included in the financial statements.


_**Finance Subsidiary**_


The Parent Company fully and unconditionally guarantees the
securities issued by Morgan Stanley Finance LLC, a wholly
owned finance subsidiary.


**Contingencies**


_**Legal**_


In addition to the matters described in the following paragraphs,
in the normal course of business, the Firm has been named, from
time to time, as a defendant in various legal actions, including
arbitrations, class actions and other litigation, arising in
connection with its activities as a global diversified financial
services institution. Certain of the actual or threatened legal
actions include claims for substantial compensatory and/or
punitive damages or claims for indeterminate amounts of



damages. In some cases, the entities that would otherwise be the
primary defendants in such cases are bankrupt or are in financial
distress. These actions have included, but are not limited to,
residential mortgage and credit crisis-related matters.


While the Firm has identified below any individual proceedings
where the Firm believes a material loss to be reasonably possible
and reasonably estimable, there can be no assurance that material
losses will not be incurred from claims that have not yet been
asserted or are not yet determined to be probable or possible and
reasonably estimable losses.


The Firm contests liability and/or the amount of damages as
appropriate in each pending matter. Where available
information indicates that it is probable a liability had been
incurred at the date of the financial statements and the Firm can

reasonably estimate the amount of that loss, the Firm accrues
the estimated loss by a charge to income.


In many proceedings and investigations, however, it is
inherently difficult to determine whether any loss is probable or
even possible or to estimate the amount of any loss. In addition,
even where a loss is possible or an exposure to loss exists in
excess of the liability already accrued with respect to a
previously recognized loss contingency, it is not always possible
to reasonably estimate the size of the possible loss or range of
loss.


For certain legal proceedings and investigations, the Firm cannot
reasonably estimate such losses, particularly for proceedings
and investigations where the factual record is being developed
or contested or where plaintiffs or government entities seek
substantial or indeterminate damages, restitution, disgorgement
or penalties. Numerous issues may need to be resolved,
including through potentially lengthy discovery and
determination of important factual matters, determination of
issues related to class certification and the calculation of

damages or other relief, and by addressing novel or unsettled
legal questions relevant to the proceedings or investigations in
question, before a loss or additional loss or range of loss or
additional range of loss can be reasonably estimated for a
proceeding or investigation.


For certain other legal proceedings and investigations, the Firm
can estimate reasonably possible losses, additional losses,
ranges of loss or ranges of additional loss in excess of amounts
accrued but does not believe, based on current knowledge and
after consultation with counsel, that such losses will have a
material adverse effect on the Firm’s financial statements as a

whole, other than the matters referred to in the following
paragraphs.


On July 15, 2010, China Development Industrial Bank
(“CDIB”) filed a complaint against the Firm, styled _China_
_Development Industrial Bank v. Morgan Stanley & Co._
_Incorporated et al._, which is pending in the Supreme Court of
the State of New York, New York County (“Supreme Court of


69 March 2020 Form 10-Q

NY”). The complaint relates to a $275 million CDS referencing
the super senior portion of the STACK 2006-1 CDO. The
complaint asserts claims for common law fraud, fraudulent
inducement and fraudulent concealment and alleges that the
Firm misrepresented the risks of the STACK 2006-1 CDO to
CDIB, and that the Firm knew that the assets backing the CDO
were of poor quality when it entered into the CDS with CDIB.
The complaint seeks compensatory damages related to the
approximately $228 million that CDIB alleges it has already lost
under the CDS, rescission of CDIB’s obligation to pay an
additional $12 million, punitive damages, equitable relief, fees
and costs. On February 28, 2011, the court denied the Firm’s
motion to dismiss the complaint. On December 21, 2018, the
court denied the Firm’s motion for summary judgment and
granted in part the Firm’s motion for sanctions relating to
spoliation of evidence. On January 24, 2019, CDIB filed a notice
of appeal from the court’s December 21, 2018 order, and on
January 25, 2019, the Firm filed a notice of appeal from the same
order. On March 7, 2019, the court denied the relief that CDIB
sought in a motion to clarify and resettle the portion of the court’s
December 21, 2018 order granting spoliation sanctions. On
December 5, 2019, the Appellate Division, First Department
(“First Department”) heard the parties’ cross appeals. Based on
currently available information, the Firm believes it could incur
a loss in this action of up to approximately $240 million plus
pre- and post-judgment interest, fees and costs.


On July 8, 2013, U.S. Bank National Association, in its capacity
as trustee, filed a complaint against the Firm styled _U.S. Bank_
_National Association, solely in its capacity as_ _Trustee of the_
_Morgan Stanley Mortgage Loan Trust 2007-2AX (MSM_
_2007-2AX) v. Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC,_
_Successor-by-Merger to Morgan_ _Stanley Mortgage_ _Capital Inc._
_and GreenPoint Mortgage Funding, Inc._, pending in the
Supreme Court of NY. The complaint asserts claims for breach
of contract and alleges, among other things, that the loans in the
trust, which had an original principal balance of approximately
$650 million, breached various representations and warranties.
The complaint seeks, among other relief, specific performance
of the loan breach remedy procedures in the transaction
documents, unspecified damages and interest. On
November 24, 2014, the court granted in part and denied in part
the Firm’s motion to dismiss the complaint. On April 4, 2019,
the court denied the Firm’s motion to renew its motion to

dismiss. Based on currently available information, the Firm
believes that it could incur a loss in this action of up to
approximately $240 million, the total original unpaid balance
of the mortgage loans for which the Firm received repurchase
demands that it did not repurchase, plus pre- and post-judgment
interest, fees and costs, but plaintiff is seeking to expand the
number of loans at issue and the possible range of loss could
increase.


On September 23, 2014, Financial Guaranty Insurance
Company (“FGIC”) filed a complaint against the Firm in the
Supreme Court of NY styled _Financial Guaranty Insurance_


March 2020 Form 10-Q 70



_Company v. Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I Inc. et al._ relating to
the Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I Inc. Trust 2007-NC4. The
complaint asserts claims for breach of contract and fraudulent
inducement and alleges, among other things, that the loans in
the trust breached various representations and warranties and
defendants made untrue statements and material omissions to

induce FGIC to issue a financial guaranty policy on certain
classes of certificates that had an original balance of
approximately $876 million. The complaint seeks, among other
relief, specific performance of the loan breach remedy
procedures in the transaction documents, compensatory,
consequential and punitive damages, attorneys’ fees and
interest. On January 23, 2017, the court denied the Firm’s motion
to dismiss the complaint. On September 13, 2018, the First
Department affirmed in part and reversed in part the lower
court’s order denying the Firm’s motion to dismiss. On
December 20, 2018, the First Department denied plaintiff’s
motion for leave to appeal its decision to the New York Court
of Appeals ("Court of Appeals") or, in the alternative, for reargument. Based on currently available information, the Firm
believes that it could incur a loss in this action of up to
approximately $277 million, the total original unpaid balance
of the mortgage loans for which the Firm received repurchase
demands from a certificate holder and FGIC that the Firm did

not repurchase, plus pre- and post- judgment interest, fees and
costs, as well as claim payments that FGIC has made and will
make in the future. In addition, plaintiff is seeking to expand the
number of loans at issue and the possible range of loss could
increase.


On January 23, 2015, Deutsche Bank National Trust Company,
in its capacity as trustee, filed a complaint against the Firm styled
_Deutsche Bank National Trust Company solely in its capacity_
_as Trustee of the Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I Inc. Trust 2007-_
_NC4 v. Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Holdings LLC as_
_Successor-by-Merger to Morgan Stanley Mortgage Capital Inc.,_
_and Morgan Stanley ABS Capital I Inc._, pending in the Supreme
Court of NY. The complaint asserts claims for breach of contract
and alleges, among other things, that the loans in the trust, which
had an original principal balance of approximately $1.05 billion,
breached various representations and warranties. The complaint
seeks, among other relief, specific performance of the loan
breach remedy procedures in the transaction documents,
compensatory, consequential, rescissory, equitable and punitive
damages, attorneys’ fees, costs and other related expenses, and
interest. On December 11, 2015, the court granted in part and
denied in part the Firm’s motion to dismiss the complaint. On
October 19, 2018, the court granted the Firm’s motion for leave
to amend its answer and to stay the case pending resolution of
Deutsche Bank National Trust Company’s appeal to the Court
of Appeals in another case, styled _Deutsche Bank National Trust_
_Company v. Barclays Bank PLC_, regarding the applicable statute
of limitations. On January 17, 2019, the First Department
reversed the trial court’s order to the extent that it had granted
in part the Firm’s motion to dismiss the complaint. On June 4,
2019, the First Department granted the Firm’s motion for leave

**Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements**
**(Unaudited)**


to appeal to the Court of Appeals. On March 19, 2020, the Firm
filed a motion for partial summary judgment. Based on currently
available information, the Firm believes that it could incur a loss
in this action of up to approximately $277 million, the total
original unpaid balance of the mortgage loans for which the Firm
received repurchase demands from a certificate holder and a
monoline insurer that the Firm did not repurchase, plus pre- and
post-judgment interest, fees and costs, but plaintiff is seeking to
expand the number of loans at issue and the possible range of
loss could increase.


_**Tax**_


In matters styled Case number 15/3637 and Case number
15/4353, the Dutch Tax Authority (“Dutch Authority”) has
challenged, in the District Court in Amsterdam, the prior set-off
by the Firm of approximately €124 million (approximately $137
million) plus accrued interest of withholding tax credits against
the Firm’s corporation tax liabilities for the tax years 2007 to
2013. The Dutch Authority alleges that the Firm was not entitled
to receive the withholding tax credits on the basis, inter alia, that
a Firm subsidiary did not hold legal title to certain securities
subject to withholding tax on the relevant dates. The Dutch
Authority has also alleged that the Firm failed to provide certain
information to the Dutch Authority and keep adequate books
and records. On April 26, 2018, the District Court in Amsterdam
issued a decision dismissing the Dutch Authority’s claims. On
June 4, 2018, the Dutch Authority filed an appeal before the
Court of Appeal in Amsterdam in matters re-styled _Case number_
_18/00318_ and _Case number 18/00319_ . On June 26 and July 2,
2019, a hearing of the Dutch Authority’s appeal was held. Based
on currently available information, the Firm believes that it
could incur a loss in this action of up to approximately €124
million (approximately $137 million) plus accrued interest.

Consolidated VIE assets and liabilities are presented in the
previous tables after intercompany eliminations. Generally,
most assets owned by consolidated VIEs cannot be removed
unilaterally by the Firm and are not available to the Firm while
the related liabilities issued by consolidated VIEs are nonrecourse to the Firm. However, in certain consolidated VIEs,
the Firm either has the unilateral right to remove assets or
provides additional recourse through derivatives such as total
return swaps, guarantees or other forms of involvement.


In general, the Firm’s exposure to loss in consolidated VIEs is
limited to losses that would be absorbed on the VIE net assets

recognized in its financial statements, net of amounts absorbed
by third-party variable interest holders.

3. Where notional amounts are utilized in quantifying the maximum exposure related to

derivatives, such amounts do not reflect changes in fair value recorded by the Firm.
4. Additional VIE assets owned represents the carrying value of total exposure to non
consolidated VIEs for which the maximum exposure to loss is less than specific
thresholds, primarily interests issued by securitization SPEs. The Firm’s primary risk
exposure is to the most subordinate class of beneficial interest and maximum exposure
to loss generally equals the fair value of the assets owned. These assets are primarily
included in Trading assets and Investment securities and are measured at fair value
(see Note 3). The Firm does not provide additional support in these transactions
through contractual facilities, guarantees or similar derivatives.


March 2020 Form 10-Q 72



The majority of the VIEs included in the previous tables are
sponsored by unrelated parties; examples of the Firm’s
involvement with these VIEs include its secondary marketmaking activities and the securities held in its Investment
securities portfolio (see Note 7).


The Firm’s maximum exposure to loss is dependent on the nature
of the Firm’s variable interest in the VIE and is limited to the

notional amounts of certain liquidity facilities and other credit
support, total return swaps and written put options, as well as
the fair value of certain other derivatives and investments the

Firm has made in the VIE.


The Firm’s maximum exposure to loss in the previous tables
does not include the offsetting benefit of hedges or any
reductions associated with the amount of collateral held as part
of a transaction with the VIE or any party to the VIE directly
against a specific exposure to loss.


Liabilities issued by VIEs generally are non-recourse to the
Firm.

1. The Transferred Assets with Continuing Involvement tables include transactions with

SPEs in which the Firm, acting as principal, transferred financial assets with
continuing involvement and received sales treatment.
2. As permitted by applicable guidance, certain transfers of assets where the Firm’s

only continuing involvement is a derivative are only reported in the following Assets
Sold with Retained Exposure table.
3. Amounts include CLO transactions managed by unrelated third parties.
4. Amounts include assets transferred by unrelated transferors.


Transferred assets are carried at fair value prior to securitization,

For a discussion of the Firm’s regulatory capital framework, see
Note 15 to the financial statements in the 2019 Form 10-K.


The Firm is required to maintain minimum risk-based and
leverage-based capital ratios under regulatory capital
requirements. A summary of the calculations of regulatory
capital and RWA follows.


Minimum risk-based capital ratio requirements apply to
Common Equity Tier 1 capital, Tier 1 capital and Total capital

(which includes Tier 2 capital). Capital standards require certain
adjustments to, and deductions from, capital for purposes of
determining these ratios. At March 31, 2020 and December 31,
2019, the Firm's ratios for determining regulatory compliance
are based on the Advanced Approach and the Standardized
Approach rules, respectively.


In the current quarter, the U.S. banking agencies have adopted
an interim final rule altering, for purposes of the regulatory
capital rules, the required adoption time period for CECL. As
of March 31, 2020, the risk-based and leverage-based capital
amounts and ratios, as well as RWA, adjusted average assets and
supplementary leverage exposure are calculated excluding the
effect of the adoption of CECL based on our election to defer
this effect over a five-year transition period in accordance with
the interim final rule.


In addition to the minimum risk-based capital ratio
requirements, the Firm is subject to the following Common
Equity Tier 1 buffers:

 - A greater than 2.5% capital conservation buffer;


- The G-SIB capital surcharge, currently at 3%; and


- Up to a 2.5% CCyB, currently set by U.S. banking agencies


at zero.

presented. Failure to maintain the buffers would result in restrictions on
the Firm’s ability to make capital distributions, including the payment of
dividends and the repurchase of stock, and to pay discretionary bonuses
to executive officers.
2. Adjusted average assets represents the denominator of the Tier 1 leverage

ratio and is composed of the average daily balance of consolidated onbalance sheet assets for the quarters ending on the respective balance
sheet dates, reduced by disallowed goodwill, intangible assets,
investments in covered funds, defined benefit pension plan assets, aftertax gain on sale from assets sold into securitizations, investments in the
Firm's own capital instruments, certain defined tax assets and other capital
deductions.
3. Supplementary leverage exposure is the sum of Adjusted average assets

used in the Tier 1 leverage ratio and other adjustments, primarily: (i) for
derivatives, potential future exposure and the effective notional principal
amount of sold credit protection offset by qualifying purchased credit
protection; (ii) the counterparty credit risk for repo-style transactions; and
(iii) the credit equivalent amount for off-balance sheet exposures.


**U.S. Bank Subsidiaries’ Regulatory Capital and Capital**
**Ratios**


The OCC establishes capital requirements for the Firm’s U.S.
Bank Subsidiaries and evaluates their compliance with such
capital requirements. Regulatory capital requirements for the
U.S. Bank Subsidiaries are calculated in a similar manner to the

Firm’s regulatory capital requirements, although G-SIB capital
surcharge requirements do not apply to the U.S. Bank
Subsidiaries.


The OCC’s regulatory capital framework includes Prompt
Corrective Action (“PCA”) standards, including “wellcapitalized” PCA standards that are based on specified
regulatory capital ratio minimums. For the Firm to remain an
FHC, the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries must remain well-capitalized
in accordance with the OCC’s PCA standards. In addition,
failure by the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries to meet minimum capital
requirements may result in certain mandatory and discretionary
actions by regulators that, if undertaken, could have a direct
material effect on the U.S. Bank Subsidiaries’ and the Firm’s

financial statements.


At March 31, 2020 and December 31, 2019, the U.S. Bank
Subsidiaries’ risk-based capital ratios are based on the
Standardized Approach rules. At March 31, 2020, the risk-based

for the period beginning July 1, 2019 through June 30, 2020.
Additionally, the Capital Plan includes quarterly common stock

Firm’s common stock to the Firm, as part of the Firm’s Share
Repurchase Program. The sales plan is only intended to maintain
MUFG’s ownership percentage below 24.9% in order to comply
with MUFG’s passivity commitments to the Board of Governors

1. Includes fees paid on Securities borrowed.
2. Includes interest from Cash and cash equivalents.
3. Includes fees received on Securities loaned.
4. Includes fees received from prime brokerage customers for stock loan transactions

entered into to cover customers’ short positions.


Interest income and Interest expense are classified in the income
statements based on the nature of the instrument and related

market conventions. When included as a component of the
instrument’s fair value, interest is included within Trading
revenues or Investments revenues. Otherwise, it is included
within Interest income or Interest expense. k


**18. Income Taxes**


The Firm is under continuous examination by the IRS and other
tax authorities in certain countries, such as Japan and the U.K.,
and in states and localities in which it has significant business
operations, such as New York.


The Firm believes that the resolution of these tax examinations

will not have a material effect on the annual financial statements,
although a resolution could have a material impact in the income
statements and on the effective tax rate for any period in which
such resolutions occur.


The Firm has established a liability for unrecognized tax
benefits, and associated interest, if applicable (“tax liabilities”),
that it believes is adequate in relation to the potential for
additional assessments. Once established, the Firm adjusts such
tax liabilities only when new information is available or when
an event occurs necessitating a change.


It is reasonably possible that significant changes in the balance
of unrecognized tax benefits may occur within the next 12
months. At this time, however, it is not possible to reasonably


March 2020 Form 10-Q 78



estimate the expected change to the total amount of
unrecognized tax benefits and the impact on the Firm’s effective
tax rate over the next 12 months.


See Note 13 regarding the Dutch Tax Authority’s challenge, in
the District Court in Amsterdam (matters styled _Case number_
_15/3637_ and _Case number 15/4353)_, of the Firm’s entitlement
to certain withholding tax credits, which may impact the balance
of unrecognized tax benefits.

3. The Firm’s Board of Directors has authorized the repurchase of the Firm’s outstanding

considers, among other things, business segment capital needs, as well as equitybased compensation and benefit plan requirements. The Share Repurchase Program
has no set expiration or termination date.

Share repurchases by the Firm are subject to regulatory nonobjection. On June 27, 2019, the Federal Reserve published
summary results of CCAR and and the Firm received a nonobjection to its 2019 Capital Plan. The Firm’s 2019 Capital Plan
includes a share repurchase of up to $6.0 billion of its
outstanding common stock during the period beginning July 1,
2019 through June 30, 2020. On March 15, 2020, the Financial
Services Forum announced that each of its eight member banks,
including the Firm, had voluntarily suspended their share
repurchase programs. For further information, see “Liquidity
and Capital Resources—Regulatory Requirements—Capital
Plans and Stress Tests .”
